#### Beer
**[Triple Voodoo](http://www.triplevoodoo.com/triplevoodoo/faces/v2/home.xhtml)**

**[Smokestack](http://www.magnoliasmokestack.com/)**, from the folks at Magnolia Brewery, recently opened (in fact, it opened after we left on our trip so I haven't been there yet). As well as their brilliant, British-style beer, I hear they serve some overpriced BBQ.

#### Wine
**[Yield Wine Bar](http://www.yieldandpause.com/)**

#### Cocktails
**[Third Rail](http://www.thirdrailbarsf.com/)**

### Food

#### Brunch/No-fuss
[Just for You](http://www.justforyoucafe.com/) is a New Orleans/Southwest brunch place. The lines on weekends get crazy, so come early. Get the beignets!

[The Lab](http://thelabcafesf.com/)

[Hard Knox](http://www.hardknoxcafe.com/) opens a little later, but 

The New Spot


If you're down for a walk over a freeway overpass, head to Potrero's 18th street corridor. I know it's cheating, but [Plow](http://www.eatatplow.com/) has an amazing brunch. Again, watch out for the lines – we've shown up twenty minutes before they opened and been the last ones to get a table.

#### Dinner/Fancier
These places also do lunch and brunch, but they're a little fancier, so they're probably better for dinner.

[Serpentine](http://www.serpentinesf.com/) is the corner space of a converted warehouse. It's clean and fresh inside and serves some great new-American food. Oh, and get one of their delicious cocktails.

[Piccino](http://www.piccinocafe.com/) 

[Long Bridge Pizza](http://longbridgepizza.com/) – finally, Dogpatch has a pizza place!

[Poquito](http://www.poquitosf.com/)

#### Cafés/Snacks
[Mr & Mrs Miscellaneous](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mr-and-Mrs-Miscellaneous/126193770733086) is amazing. Their flavours are
