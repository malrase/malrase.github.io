My home neighbourhood (or "[micro-hood](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/2844-microhood-goodness-in-dogpatch)", as the Bolt Italic calls it) in San Francisco, [Dogpatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogpatch,_San_Francisco) is often described as "up-and-coming." Even since we moved in almost two years ago, the number of bars and restaurants has increased a tonne. In fact, most of the places listed below are pretty new to the scene.

### Things to Do

The **[Museum of Craft and Design](http://www.sfmcd.org/)** has a regularly-changing set of exhibits focussed on design.

### Drink

Firstly, here's a [map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zSa_dTkSRnX0.k_Ff5BlXQakY) of important eating and drinking spots.

#### Beer
**[Triple Voodoo](http://www.triplevoodoo.com/triplevoodoo/faces/v2/home.xhtml)** just opened a sizeable tap room on Third Street. They have a good range of beers there, plus offer food from The New Spot (described later).

**[Smokestack](http://www.magnoliasmokestack.com/)**, from the folks at Magnolia Brewery, recently opened (in fact, it opened after we left on our trip so I haven't been there yet). As well as their brilliant, British-style beer, I hear they serve some overpriced BBQ.

#### Wine
**[Yield Wine Bar](http://www.yieldandpause.com/)** has friendly, knowledgeable staff, with a relaxed atmosphere. They also serve great food (with some vegetarian/vegan options).

#### Cocktails
**[Dogpatch Saloon](http://dogpatchsaloon.com/)** re-opened recently after a refurbishment. This is our favourite bar – it's got a welcoming neighbourhood feel, bustling on a sunny afternoon as much as a late night. They have some great cocktails and a good beer list.

**[Third Rail](http://www.thirdrailbarsf.com/)** makes high-end cocktails in a quiet, nicely-designed setting.

**[Sea Star](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sea-star-club-san-francisco-2)** only just opened as we left on our trip. I only went a couple of times, and it was still finding its footing.

### Eat

#### Brunch/No-fuss
**[Just for You](http://www.justforyoucafe.com/)** is a New Orleans/Southwest brunch place. The lines on weekends get crazy, so come early. Get the beignets!

I've only been to **[The Lab](http://thelabcafesf.com/)** twice, and it was pretty good. There's certainly less of a line than for some of the other brunch places, plus it's nice to sit on 22nd St and watch people go by.

**[Hard Knox](http://www.hardknoxcafe.com/)** opens a little later, but has an amazing fried chicken and waffle menu item.

**[The New Spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-new-spot-san-francisco)** is a pretty great tacqueria. I still haven't quite figured out its opening times, though – it's closed on random times I've walked past.

If you're down for a walk over a freeway overpass, head to Potrero's 18th street corridor. I know it's cheating, but **[Plow](http://www.eatatplow.com/)** has an amazing brunch. Again, watch out for the lines – we've shown up twenty minutes before they opened and been the last ones to get a table.

#### Dinner/Fancier
These places also do lunch and brunch, but they're a little fancier, so they're probably better for dinner.

**[Serpentine](http://www.serpentinesf.com/)** is the corner space of a converted warehouse. It's bright and fresh inside and serves some great new-American food. Oh, and get one of their delicious cocktails.

**[Piccino](http://www.piccinocafe.com/)** has light, fresh Italian-inspired food. They only have a small regularly-changing menu, but it's difficult to go wrong. The funghi pizza is great, but I usually go for whatever pasta they have. They also have a café where you can grab coffee and some tasty pastries.

**[Long Bridge Pizza](http://longbridgepizza.com/)** – finally, Dogpatch has a pizza place! I managed to eat there a couple of times before we left, and it was a thin-crust, traditional style pizza.

**[Poquito](http://www.poquitosf.com/)** the food can be hit-or-miss at this place. It's Latin-American tapas. The drinks are good, though, so I'd recommend sitting at the bar and maybe grabbing a couple of snacks.

#### Other
**[Mr & Mrs Miscellaneous](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mr-and-Mrs-Miscellaneous/126193770733086)** is amazing. Their flavours are innovative and I'd suggest going out of your comfort zone when picking one. They change ice-creams regularly, so it's difficult to recommend a flavour, but if they have bourbon caramel – get that. Or the boiled peanut.

**[Olivier's Butchery](http://www.oliviersbutchery.com/)** – I'd never really been to a butcher before, usually relying on supermarket cuts of meat. However, I quickly became a convert. Sure, it's a little expensive, but that just means that it's a treat when you do get something. They offer delicious (and usual) cuts of meat, plus some pre-made items like rôtis or home-made sausages.
