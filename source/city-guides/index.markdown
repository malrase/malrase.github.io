There are a few cities that I've become familiar with â€“ through frequent travel or living there for a while. Through that, I've either written a number of blog posts or just know a few places I'd recommend. 

I decided to collate a lot of this information into city guides. Each guide acts as a collection of any blog posts as well as broad overall tips on the city, where I've enjoyed eating, and, most importantly, **good drinking spots**.

Hopefully this list will grow as I spend more time in various cities.

 - London (coming soon!)
 - Paris (coming soon!)
 - [Prague](/city-guides/prague)
 - San Francisco
   - [Dogpatch](/city-guides/san-francisco/dogpatch)
