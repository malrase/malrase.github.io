There are a few cities that I've become familiar with â€“ through frequent travel or living there for a while. Some of these cities I've written a number of posts about. I decided to collate a lot of this information into city guides, Each guide acts as a collection of these posts as well as broad overall tips on the city, where I've enjoyed eating, and, most importantly, good drinking spots.

Hopefully this list will grow as I spend more time in various cities.

### Europe 

 - London (coming soon!)
 - Paris (coming soon!)
 - [Prague](city-guides/europe/prague)

### North America
