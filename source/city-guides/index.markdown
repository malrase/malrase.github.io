As I've travelled, there have been cities that I've visited a bunch of times, or stayed in for a while. I decided to collate a lot of the information into city guides, as I sometimes write a number of posts for some cities. Each guide acts as a collection of these posts as well as broad overall tips on the city, where I've enjoyed eating, and, most importantly, good drinking spots.

Hopefully this list will grow as I spend more time in various cities.

### Europe 

 - London (coming soon!)
 - Paris (coming soon!)
 - [Prague](city-guides/europe/prague)

### North America

 - San Francisco (coming soon!)
