### Bars

The level of cocktail competency in Prague is far, far higher than most other European cities we've visited. However there are a number of over-hyped bars too.

[Map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zSa_dTkSRnX0.k-PlCRk2mXRs).

Some of the places have their own posts, but some are just written here. I've ordered them by my ranking, from highest to lowest, so if you're visiting Prague... start at the top and work your way down.

**[Hemingway Bar](http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/)**: [Reviewed here](/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/), overall: 8.1/10.

**[Groove Bar](http://groovebar.cz/)**: This place became our preferred spot for drinks very quickly. The music is great and there's a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. The drinks are far cheaper, and just as delicious, as most of the other places on this list. Get the signature Greenteani, it's refreshing, smooth and thoroughly drinkable. Also, this is where [Absinthe Prague](/blog/2014/07/11/absinthe-tasting-prague) happens.

Overall: 7.9/10

**[Tretter's](http://www.tretters.cz/en/)**: styled as a "New York" bar, this place has a great menu – a mix of classics and modern inventions. We're both a little tired of the faux-20s-New York thing that seems to be popular in Europe. Putting a bunch of black and white photos of Manhattan on your wall doesn't work. I'd like to see someone do an L.A.-style bar from the 40s. That'd be neat.

Anyway, despite that, we really enjoyed this place. The cocktails were delicious and the bartenders were super-friendly. I'd recommend this place over Bugsy's Bar!

**[Black Angel's Bar](http://www.blackangelsbar.cz/)**: [Reviewed here](/blog/2014/07/17/black-angels-bar-prague), overall: 6.8/10.

**[Cloud 9 Bar (in the Hilton Prague)](http://cloud9.cz)**: [Reviewed here](/blog/2014/07/19/cloud-9-prague), overall: 6.3/10.

**[Bonvivants](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d6375998-Reviews-BONVIVANT_s_CTC-Prague_Bohemia.html)**: I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short in a number of ways. I read about it in the New York Times in a [36 Hours in Prague](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/travel/36-hours-in-prague.html) travel piece. It's a tapas restaurant/cocktail bar/café. We went early on a Friday, and it was pretty empty. The bar was strangely laid out – with a lot of empty space and some tables around the edges. The menu was good and we ordered a couple of tapas and a cocktail each. Mine was the Provence cocktail – it had gin, chartreuse, lemon and lavender in it. The bartender came over, lit a piece of lavender, and wafted it over the cocktail. It was super-tasty!

Hampton had a manhattan (obviously), and the vermouth was off. That's where things started going wrong. It took ages to get our food – and when it did come, only one plate of the two came out. The food was decent, but not spectacular, and not really worth the wait.

Overall: 5.1/10

**[Zinc Lounge (in the Hilton Prague Old Town)](http://www.hiltonpragueoldtown.com/loungebar-en.html)**: [Reviewed here](), overall: 4.6/10

### Restaurants

I've been posting way too much about drinking, so I thought I'd talk about some of the food we've had in Prague. Of course, there's Czech food a-plenty. Much as in Paris you can't walk 100ft without finding a brasserie, in Prague there's a huge number of traditional restaurants.

Lots of dumplings, cabbage, stewed meats. [picture] There's a surprising amount of rabbit on menus over here. It's nice when "unconventional" meats (I use quotes as it's relative to North American food) are regularly on the menu. I usually eat way too much lamb when I'm in Europe.

Our favourite Czech restaurant so far was [Rainer Maria Rilke](http://www.rmrilke.cz/) (which is conveniently just by [Hemingway Bar!](/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague)). Other good places are [U Medvídků](http://www.umedvidku.cz/index.php/en/) or [Restaurace Ostrovní](http://www.restauraceostrovni.cz/en/).

There's also a number of great non-Czech restaurants, especially French and Italian cuisine. On the French side of things, the best we've eaten has been at [Renommé](http://renomme.cz/). We had a beautiful salmon-dill tartare and foie gras to start. We've been eating so much foie gras on this trip as you can [no longer buy it in California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_foie_gras_law). For our main, Hampton got their hamburger (yes, I know that's not French, but whatever) and it was incredible. Layers of bacon, cheese, caramelised onions, truffle mayonnaise. I got the rabbit (duh), mainly for the herb spaetzle. The richness of the rabbit was cut with the herbiness of the spaetzle and it was amazing.

I forgot to take photos, but I've found a couple on the internet. Here's [a picture of their hamburger](http://www.expats.cz/content_files/2765/palanda-2.jpg), and [one of the foie gras](http://www.praguepost.cz/pictures/1-20120125-11823-8100-pic.jpg).

[La Gare](http://www.brasserielagare.cz/):

**[School]()**:

Italian food is everywhere – especially pizza. There's really good delivery, which is always nice. I've also had some of the best gnocchi while here. [Uno](http://www.unorestaurant.cz/), despite being in a [massive shopping centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_\(Prague)), had some great pasta. At least, the chicken-mushroom gnocchi was.

There is a large [Vietnamese community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people_in_the_Czech_Republic) in the Czech Republic, and I've had some pretty great pho since I've been here. In particular, [Wok & Sushi](https://foursquare.com/v/wok--sushi/53839b8b498ebb8d532928ed) was delicious.

Sansho, [already reviewed](/blog/2014/07/15/sansho-prague).

We tried out a conveyor-belt all-you-can-eat sushi, also in the Palladium:
[Makakiko](http://www.makakiko.cz/enmain.php). I know, it sounds absurd. And it was. I've only been to a couple of conveyor-belt sushi places before, and those wer in the UK. It seemed
