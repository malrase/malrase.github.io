Hi, I'm Michael, a front-end web developer and technical writer. I live in San Francisco, California. That there is a photo of me looking like a hipster.

I grew up in [small](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluntisham) [villages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swavesey) in [Cambridgeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire). I studied [biochemistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry) at Oxford, then a bit of developmental biology at Cambridge. After those, I switched from biological sciences to technology.

I co-wrote (with [Hampton](http://twitter.com/hcatlin)) the [Pragmatic Guide to Sass](http://pragprog.com/book/pg_sass/pragmatic-guide-to-sass). I also worked at [Moovweb](http://moovweb.com), where I wrote the [Programmers' Guide to Mobile Development](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Moovweb_Platform.html?id=5R8ynwEACAAJ). I currently work on two things. I do consulting work at [rarebit](http://teamrarebit.com), which I co-founded with Hampton. I do front-end web development â€“ plus design and back-end from time-to-time.

I also work on [Wordset](http://www.wordset.org), the world's first collaborative structured dictionary.

Outside of work, I [tweet](http://twitter.com/malrase) and [take photos of drinks](http://instagram.com/malrase). I like reading (check out my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6233721-michael-lintorn-catlin) and make me some recommendations). I also like watching films and I get way too excited about the Oscars (or [any awards show](http://pool.malrase.com), to be honest). When I get a little tipsy, I'll try to talk to you in broken French, Spanish or German. I'm sorry about that.
