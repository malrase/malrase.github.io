This post has an awkward title. That's chiefly because the bars in New York are so numerous that I couldn't claim knowledge of even 0.1 percent. I couldn't even claim to have exhausted bars in Chelsea (our current neighbourhood), or even the Ninth Avenue bit of Chelsea. In fact, a more accurate title for this post would be "Bars Between 20th and 17th Streets on Ninth Avenue: A Small Sampling." It's strange coming from Prague, where we managed to check off almost all of the decent cocktail bars in the centre, to a city where we've barely scratched the surface of our neighbourhood.

Anyway, we've been trying out some of the recommended bars in the area. We haven't found a bar we're completely comfortable with – the nice mix of decent cocktails and relaxed atmosphere has eluded us so far in Chelsea.

The [Tipsy Parson](http://tipsyparson.com/) is a great restaurant as well as a pretty good cocktail bar. You know how often, a Southern-style restaurant can't beat the food you actually get in the South? Well, that's not the case here. I had fried catfish with gravy, and Hampton had shrimp and grits. Both were great – the catfish was crisp and the gravy wasn't too peppery (which happens a lot with Southern gravy).

Looking at the menu, we spotted the head chef's name: Ty-Lör Boring. That's quite an unusual na- wait, it's [*that* Ty-Lör](http://www.bravotv.com/people/ty-lor-boring/bio), from Top Chef?! It was!

They also have seats at the bar. The cocktails are a little bit hit and miss. They're trying hard to be inventive, but a lot of them miss the mark. There was a ginger-based drink that was *way* too gingery, even for me. The Professor Plum was pretty good, although due to seasonal changes of the menu I don't think it's available any more.

[Bathtub Gin](http://bathtubginnyc.com/) is a speakeasy behind a coffee shop. It's quite conspicuous for a speakeasy – walking past on a Saturday night you see a line of people outside.We booked for 6pm on a quiet night and even then the bouncer made us wait outside.

The drinks were quite good. We started out with a Martini and a Blushing Lady #2.

The Blushing Lady #2 tasted like a sour grape candy. The Martini was OK. The secound round proved better – a Vesper and a Last Word.

They had some great small plates to share – the mushroom gnocchi was my favourite. The pork belly sliders were also super-tasty.

[La Bottega](http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php) is in a crazy-looking hotel called the Maritime. Its windows are all circular.

Some other bars we've been to in the Chelsea area are [The Park](http://www.theparknyc.com/), on 10th avenue, and [Heartwood](http://heartwoodnyc.com/), on 8th.
