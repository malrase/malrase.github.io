I stumbled across [Drinks International's list of the top 50 cocktail bars](http://www.drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/4841/Artesian_named_The_World_92s_50_Best_Bars_champion_2014.html) in the world. Sure, it's probably a list you can pay to appear on or whatever. On our trip we managed to hit six of them, though, so I'm feeling pretty good about that.

- 3 - [Nightjar](/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar/), London
- 12 - [Happiness Forgets](http://www.happinessforgets.com/), London
- 17 - [Candelaria](/blog/2014/05/24/cocktails-in-paris/), Paris
- 24 - [Hemingway Bar](/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/), Prague
- 26 - [Door 74](/blog/2014/08/09/amsterdam-food/), Amsterdam
- 49 - [Callooh Callay](http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/welcome/), London

The only other one I'd been to was #16, [Smuggler's Cove](http://smugglerscovesf.com/trapdoor/), in San Francisco. I still haven't been to #33, [Trick Dog](http://www.trickdogbar.com/) – although it's been on my to-do list for a while. I'll probably head there as soon as I get back to SF.

As we've only got two more nights in New York, I'm not too sure we'll be able to hit the NYC ones on the list. But it's good to know they're out there.
