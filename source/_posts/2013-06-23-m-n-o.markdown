- Morrison, Toni - The Bluest Eye - 7.6/10
- Naipaul, V.S. - A House for Mr Biswas - 8.3/10
- O'Brien, Flan - At Swim-Two-Birds - 2.1/10 °

As I'm just over half-way through the alphabet, I'm going to do a top five books so far:

5) In Cold Blood - Capote
4) Under the Skin - Faber
3) Dubliners - Joyce
2) A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius - Eggers
1) I, Claudius - Graves

° I couldn't even finish it. I made it to the half-way point, then had to stop. The book is supposed to be (partly) a take on Joyce, but I found the obfuscated narrative unreadable. Maybe this is what Finnegan's Wake is like?
