We've been exploring the Prague cocktail scene for the past month, and I thought I'd give a summary of some of the places we've been to. Some are really great, but there's a number of over-hyped ones too.

**[Groove Bar]()**: 

**[Bonvivants](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d6375998-Reviews-BONVIVANT_s_CTC-Prague_Bohemia.html)**: I really wanted to like this place. I read about it in the New York Times in a [36 Hours in Prague](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/travel/36-hours-in-prague.html) travel piece. 

Overall: 5.8/10

**[Bugsy's Bar](http://www.bugsysbar.cz/)**: I found this place online, and it's supposedly one of the nicer cocktail bars in Prague. If you like Hemmingways, Foursquare said, you'd like Bugsy's. [Their website](http://www.bugsysbar.cz/) is very slick – look how dapper the bartenders are, with their bow-ties and braces! Anyway, we went past a scary bouncer and down into a basement where the only lighting seemed to come from neon-pink spotlights pointed at the ceiling.

The crowd was... strange. Everyone was dressed as if they were in a club. Short skirts and heels for women, blazers and super-shiny shoes for the guys. When we walked out later that evening, we realised we must be in the "club" district, as every other doorway had a bouncer and a line of people waiting to get in. Maybe Bugsy's is more of a pre-club venue.

We sat down and were presented with one of the most amazing drink menus I've seen. It's a thick book with everything designed as a graphic novel. The cocktails are split into broad categories, and each category has a beautiful double-page followed by a few pages of a story. We follow a single character through a noir scene (for classic cocktails), a Caribbean adventure (for rum cocktails), a scene with Batman (for "Gotham Cocktails," whatever they are). There was even a page for mocktails where our hero ended up being pulled over and passing a breathalyser test.

Anyway, the range of cocktails (despite the menu) was pretty disappointing. Nearly all were either classics, or vague variations on rum cocktails only. I got a gin fizz and Hampton a vesper. For a bar snack, the server gave us this shot-glass of things that looked like crisps. Turns out they were some kind of weird string-cheese that had been rolled in spices or something? It was super-weird.

I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. That plus my confusion (or their confusion) of what the bar *was*. The cocktails were pretty high-end, and not cheap. Yet mix that with the disco soundtrack, weird pink lighting everywhere, and about-to-go-clubbing crowd and I didn't really feel comfortable.

Overall: 3.4/10

**[Tretter's](http://www.tretters.cz/en/)**: styled as a "New York" bar, this place has a great menu – a mix of classics and modern.

Overall: 7.2/10
