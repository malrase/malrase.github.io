As you may have noticed from the number of posts recently, we've been exploring the Prague cocktail scene for the past month. I thought I'd give a summary post of some of the places we've been to. [Here's a map of them](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zSa_dTkSRnX0.k-PlCRk2mXRs). The level of cocktail competency in Prague is far, far higher than most other cities we've visited. However there are a number of over-hyped bars too.

Some of the reviews have their own posts, but some are just written here. I've ordered them from highest to lowest, so if you're visiting Prague... start at the top and work your way down.

**[Hemingway Bar](http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/)**: [Reviewed here](/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/), overall: 8.1/10.

**[Groove Bar](http://groovebar.cz/)**: This place became our preferred spot for drinks very quickly. The music is great and there's a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. The drinks are far cheaper, and just as delicious, as most of the other places on this list. Get the signature Greenteani, it's refreshing, smooth and thoroughly drinkable. Also, this is where [Absinthe Prague](/blog/2014/07/11) happens.

**[Tretter's](http://www.tretters.cz/en/)**: styled as a "New York" bar, this place has a great menu – a mix of classics and modern inventions. We're both a little tired of the faux-20s-New York thing that seems to be popular in Europe. Putting a bunch of black and white photos of Manhattan on your wall doesn't work. I'd like to see someone do an L.A.-style bar from the 40s. That'd be neat.

Anyway, despite that, we really enjoyed this place. The cocktails were delicious and the bartenders were super-friendly. I'd recommend this place over Bugsy's Bar!

Overall: 7.5/10

**[Bonvivants](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d6375998-Reviews-BONVIVANT_s_CTC-Prague_Bohemia.html)**: I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short in a number of ways. I read about it in the New York Times in a [36 Hours in Prague](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/travel/36-hours-in-prague.html) travel piece. It's a tapas restaurant/cocktail bar/café. We went early on a Friday, and it was pretty empty. The bar was strangely laid out – with a lot of empty space and some tables around the edges. The menu was good and we ordered a couple of tapas and a cocktail each. Mine was the Provence cocktail – it had gin, chartreuse, lemon and lavender in it. The bartender came over, lit a piece of lavender, and wafted it over the cocktail. It was super-tasty!

Hampton had a manhattan (obviously), and the vermouth was off. That's where things started going wrong. It took ages to get our food – and when it did come, only one plate of the two came out. The food was decent, but not spectacular, and not really worth the wait.

Overall: 5.1/10
