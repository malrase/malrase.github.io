We've been exploring the Prague cocktail scene for the past month, and I thought I'd give a summary of some of the places we've been to. Some are really great, but there's a number of over-hyped ones too.

**[Groove Bar](http://groovebar.cz/)**: This place became our preferred spot for drinks very quickly. The music is great and there's a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. The drinks are far cheaper, and just as delicious, as most of the other places on this list. Get the signature Greenteani, it's refreshing, smooth and thoroughly drinkable.

**[Bonvivants](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d6375998-Reviews-BONVIVANT_s_CTC-Prague_Bohemia.html)**: I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short in a number of ways. I read about it in the New York Times in a [36 Hours in Prague](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/travel/36-hours-in-prague.html) travel piece. It's a tapas restaurant/cocktail bar/café. We went early on a Friday, and it was pretty empty. The bar was strangely laid out – with a lot of empty space and some tables around the edges. The menu was good and we ordered a couple of tapas and a cocktail each. Mine was the Provence cocktail – it had gin, chartreuse, lemon and lavender in it. The bartender came over, lit a piece of lavender, and wafted it over the cocktail. It was super-tasty!

Hampton had a manhattan (obviously), and the vermouth was off. That's where things started going wrong. It took ages to get our food – and when it did come, only one plate of the two came out. The food was decent, but not spectacular, and not really worth the wait.

Overall: 5.8/10

**[Bugsy's Bar](http://www.bugsysbar.cz/)**: I found this place online, and it's supposedly one of the nicer cocktail bars in Prague. If you like Hemmingways, Foursquare said, you'd like Bugsy's. [Their website](http://www.bugsysbar.cz/) is very slick – look how dapper the bartenders are, with their bow-ties and braces! Anyway, we went past a scary bouncer and down into a basement where the only lighting seemed to come from neon-pink spotlights pointed at the ceiling.

The crowd was... strange. Everyone was dressed as if they were in a club. Short skirts and heels for women, blazers and super-shiny shoes for the guys. When we walked out later that evening, we realised we must be in the "club" district, as every other doorway had a bouncer and a line of people waiting to get in. Maybe Bugsy's is more of a pre-club venue.

We sat down and were presented with one of the most amazing drink menus I've seen. It's a thick book designed as a graphic novel. The cocktails are split into broad categories, and each category has a beautiful double-page spread followed by a few pages of a story. We follow a single character through a noir scene (for classic cocktails), a Caribbean adventure (for rum cocktails), a scene with Batman (for "Gotham Cocktails," whatever they are), and so on. There was even a page for mocktails where our hero ended up being pulled over and passing a breathalyser test.

Anyway, the range of cocktails (despite the menu) was pretty disappointing. Nearly all were either classics, or vague variations on rum cocktails. I got a gin fizz and Hampton a vesper. For a bar snack, the server gave us this shot-glass of things that looked like undercooked chips. Turns out they were some kind of weird string-cheese that had been rolled in spices or something? It was super-weird.

I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. That plus my confusion (or their confusion) of what the bar *was*. The cocktails were pretty high-end, and not cheap. Yet mix that with the disco soundtrack, weird pink lighting everywhere, and about-to-go-clubbing crowd and I didn't really want to spend a lot of time there.

Overall: 3.4/10

**[Tretter's](http://www.tretters.cz/en/)**: styled as a "New York" bar, this place has a great menu – a mix of classics and modern inventions. We're both a little tired of the faux-20s-New York thing that seems to be popular in Europe. Putting a bunch of black and white photos of Manhattan on your wall doesn't work. I'd like to see someone do an L.A.-style bar from the 40s. That'd be neat.

Anyway, despite that, we really enjoyed this place. The cocktails were delicious and the bartenders were super-friendly. I'd recommend this place over Bugsy's Bar!

Overall: 7.5/10

**[Black Angel Bar](http://www.blackangelsbar.cz/)**: this place was recomended to us by a number of people – both bartenders and general cocktail-lovers. It's in a basement just off the old town square, underneath a hotel. As we were taken down to the bar, we were warned about a long list of "no nos": no cameras, no hats, no speaking too loud. It was a weird way to be introduced to a bar.

The cocktails were inventive and presented well. They had a broad menu – a bunch of famous bartenders (I can't vouch for their renown as I hadn't heard of any of them. Saying that, I don't know if I *could* name a famous bartender.) came up with a list of drinks. There's a lot of award-winning cocktails in there too. I had a couple of pre-prohibition ones, which were delicious.

Despite the cocktails being great, there was something a little off about the place. I'm not sure if it was the number of tourists (it is just off the main square, after all) or the man at the piano playing the theme song to Forrest Gump (?!), but it wasn't as enjoyable of an experience as I thought it would be.

Oh, and watch out for the bathrooms. They charge for their use for non-customers. I got confused and paid the person, but turns out that wasn't necessary. (There was a sign saying "No charge for guests," but I assumed they meant guests of the hotel.)

Overall: 6.8/10
