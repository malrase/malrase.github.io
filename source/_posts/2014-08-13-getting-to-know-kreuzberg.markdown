Berlin doesn't feel European. It's not quite like anywhere else Hampton and I have visited. Sure, Paris has... *Parisian* things about it that make it unique – but it still feels European. Berlin does not. Maybe it's because  of its recent tumultuous history. Maybe it's because the idea of "Europeanness" includes Paris, and London, and Rome, but somehow left out Berlin. **NEEDS CLOSING SENTENCE**


Last time we visited, we stayed in [Prenzlauer Berg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenzlauer_Berg), a hip ex-East Berlin neighbourhood in the north of the city. This time, we chose to stay in [Kreuzberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg).

Along with Prenzlauer Berg and [Friedrichshain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain), Kreuzberg is considered to be the trendier, less-polished side of the city. Although technically in West Berlin during the separation of Germany, Kreuzberg was on the eastern edge of the city, so was relatively underdeveloped. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, all three neighbourhoods have undergone varying levels of gentrification.

Coming from the obvious beauty of Prague or Amsterdam, Berlin was a little brutal. On our block, there are multiple featureless, indistinguishable mid-1970s apartment complexes. They're covered in graffiti and look pretty drab.

So far, I'm probably not painting a great picture of Berlin, am I? The thing that really draws Hampton and me to the city is the people and the atmosphere. I'd call it artistic or care-free; I'm sure an American could equally describe it as entrepreneurial. Confused? Let me try and describe an example.

We're staying just off the [Spree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree). It's a little industrial along our side of the river, with brick warehouses and lots of gates. We saw some place recommended on FourSquare along the river, but weren't that sure where it was. After walking through what looked like a gate to an industrial estate, we saw a couple of shipping containers stacked on top of each other with a 1970s car on top. As you continue walking towards the bank of the river, you see a makeshift beach.
