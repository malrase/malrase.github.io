I've been posting way too much about drinking, so I thought I'd talk about some of the food we've had in Prague. Of course, there's Czech food a-plenty. Much as in Paris you can't walk 100ft without finding a brasserie, in Prague there's a huge number of traditional restaurants.

Lots of dumplings, cabbage, stewed meats. [picture] There's a surprising amount of rabbit on menus over here. It's nice when "unconventional" meats (I use quotes as it's relative to North American food) are regularly on the menu. I usually eat way too much lamb when I'm in Europe.

Our favourite Czech restaurant so far was [Rainer Maria Rilke](http://www.rmrilke.cz/) (which is conveniently just by [Hemingway Bar!](/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague)). Other good places are [U Medvídků](http://www.umedvidku.cz/index.php/en/) or [Restaurace Ostrovní](http://www.restauraceostrovni.cz/en/).

There's also a number of great non-Czech restaurants, especially French and Italian cuisine. On the French side of things, the best we've eaten has been at [Renommé](http://renomme.cz/). We had a beautiful salmon-dill tartare and foie gras to start. We've been eating so much foie gras on this trip as you can [no longer buy it in California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_foie_gras_law). For our main, Hampton got their hamburger (yes, I know that's not French, but whatever) and it was incredible. Layers of bacon, cheese, caramelised onions, truffle mayonnaise. I got the rabbit (duh), mainly for the herb spaetzle. The richness of the rabbit was cut with the herbiness of the spaetzle and it was amazing.

I forgot to take photos, but I've found a couple on the internet. Here's [a picture of their hamburger](http://www.expats.cz/content_files/2765/palanda-2.jpg), and [one of the foie gras](http://www.praguepost.cz/pictures/1-20120125-11823-8100-pic.jpg).

**[School]()**:

Italian food is everywhere – especially pizza. There's really good delivery, which is always nice. I've also had some of the best gnocchi while here. [Uno](http://www.unorestaurant.cz/), despite being in a [massive shopping centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_\(Prague)), had some great pasta. At least, the chicken-mushroom gnocchi was.

There is a large [Vietnamese community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people_in_the_Czech_Republic) in the Czech Republic, and I've had some pretty great pho since I've been here. In particular, [Wok & Sushi](https://foursquare.com/v/wok--sushi/53839b8b498ebb8d532928ed) was delicious.

We tried out a conveyor-belt all-you-can-eat sushi, also in the Palladium:
[Makakiko](http://www.makakiko.cz/enmain.php). I know, it sounds absurd. And it was. I've only been to a couple of conveyor-belt sushi places before, and those wer in the UK. It seemed
