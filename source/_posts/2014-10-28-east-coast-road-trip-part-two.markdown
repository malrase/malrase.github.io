On the southern outskirts of Asheville is the [Biltmore Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate). Built by the Vanderbilt family in the 1890s, it's the largest home in the U.S.A. and is open for tours. It's ridiculously pricey to visit – $60 per person is the cheapest adult ticket. The audio guide is well worth the extra $10. If you're spending $60 already... might as well, right?

I've been to a fair share of grand homes in the UK and France, and it was interesting to see the American version of that. Obviously, this house was built way after [Blenheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace) or [Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles). It had a bunch of more modern aspects that surprised me. For example, electricity was used widely throughout the house – the clocks were synchronised that way. The indoor swimming pool (!) was lit with DC bulbs. There was an electric [dumbwaiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbwaiter_(elevator\)) from the kitchens. All of these "modern" marvels I'd never seen in a grand home before.

It was obviously a *home*, which isn't necessarily clear in other stately homes. Wandering around Versailles, how easy is it to imagine people living their lives there? Pretty tricky, in my opinion. Biltmore felt planned as a home – areas for family friends, areas for casual everyday living. It was far more welcoming in that regard.

Asheville itself seemed nice, although we didn't stay in the centre. The only place we managed to get to was [The Admiral](http://theadmiralnc.com/), in the west. It was recommended by a number of people. Booking reservations was tricky – on a Monday night the only two slots were 5:30pm and 9pm. It's a popular place!

From the outside, it doesn't look like much.
