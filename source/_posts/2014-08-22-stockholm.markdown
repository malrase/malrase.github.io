We spent a few days in [Stockholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm) for this year's [HybridConf](http://hybridconf.net/). It's been a lot of fun, and I really recommend checking the conference out. Although I've been to Sweden once before, I've never been to Stockholm so I was pretty excited to check out this new city.

We only really had time for one day of touring, and when Hampton and I tour a city, we take it seriously. We looked up the top three things to do in Stockholm and made it a priority to check them off.

Stockholm is built on a bunch of islands – an archipelago, really. The centralmost island is [Gamla Stan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan), "Old Town". It has winding cobbled streets and alleyways and it's also the home of the royal palace. That's where we started our walking tour.

It was pretty, but full of tourist shops. We quickly headed over to the neighbouring island to check out the [Moderna Museet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Museet). Although not as big as, say, MoMA or the Tate Modern, the collection is really good. It's manageable in size but also offers a great narrative over 20th century art.

After that, we island hopped again – this time taking a ferry to visit the [Vasa Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_museum). There's also a [theme park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund) on the island – but it wasn't open. Sad times!

Anyway, the [Vasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship\)) was a ship built in 1620s in preparation for a war against Poland. On its maiden voyage, it sank about 20 minutes after setting sail. It lay in the Stockholm bay for over 300 years, until it was recovered in the 1960s.
