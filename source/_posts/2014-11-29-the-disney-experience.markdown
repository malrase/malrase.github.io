For our fifth-year anniversary, we decided to head down to [Walt Disney World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World) for a few days. I had never stayed "on property" (i.e. in a Disney-branded hotel) before, so we opted to stay in the [French Quarter New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Port_Orleans_Resort). It's in the middle of the pack with regards to cost – not as expensive as the Grand Floridian or the Contemporary, but not as cheap as the All-Star resorts. (See a handy table on the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World#On-site_Disney_resorts).)

We also did this to get the new Disney [MagicBand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyMagic%2B#MagicBand). It's an all-in-one ticket to the parks, key to your room, and FastPass. We were really excited about getting them. You customise them online and they come in the mail.

The packaging reminded me of an Apple product – it was uncluttered and put the product up front.

The bands even had our names on the inside in case they got mixed up.

Staying on-site also gives you the opportunity to take the Disney buses from hotels to the parks. You don't need to worry about driving to and from the parks. We decided to do the Disney dining plan, too – one snack, one quick meal, and one sit-down meal per day.

We checked into the hotel, and although the surroundings were nice, the room was disappointing. It was laid out exactly like a motel – a sink area you can see as you walk in the door, a curtain to separate it from the rest of the room. It seemed like that could be a useful layout for families, but it didn't have the "magical" feeling I was expecting – especially for the price we were paying. I couldn't help but compare it to the far better Royal Lowes Pacific Resort at Universal.

We were there for four days – with one day in each of the four WDW parks. On our first day, we headed to [Epcot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot) to catch the end of the [Food and Wine Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot_International_Food_%26_Wine_Festival). Held every autumn, they put up extra food stands around the [World Showcase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot#World_Showcase) representing different countries/cultures.

Anyway, as Epcot is one of the parks where you can drink, we decided to take advantage of the Disney bus system. Here's a pro-tip: **don't use the Disney bus system**. Waiting at our hotel's bus stop, empty buses would often go past. Three or four buses for the same park would go past, no one being picked up. When our bus did come by, it was packed. After about fifteen minutes' wait, it was another fifteen minutes to get to the park. Then you're dropped off quite far from the entrance, so there's some extra walking. It was **not** worth it. In the Disney vs. Universal battle, the walkable distance from Universal to the resort hotels makes Universal a much more convenient experience.

Our day at Epcot was a lot of fun, though. Spending a whole day at Epcot allowed us to wander through the World Showcase. We managed to walk through all the countries – into the back areas and shops where there were few people. The amount of detail is incredible. It also helps that some of the countries (such as France and Germany) have wine. That kept us in a good mood.

We did Hollywood Studios the next day, then the Magic Kingdom. I was blown away by how busy the Magic Kingdom was – it was a Wednesday in the off-season and even high-throughput rides like Pirates of the Caribbean or the Haunted Mansion were at 50-minute queue times.

Two other disappointing things: the dining package and the FastPass options on the MagicBand.

I don't think we'll be staying at a Disney resort any time soon. If we do, I think it would have to be one with better transit options (i.e. one on the monorail). Driving to the parks is a far better option than the bus.
