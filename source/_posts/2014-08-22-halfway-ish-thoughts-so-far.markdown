### Living from a carry-on
It's not that bad, to be honest. I'm getting a little tired of the clothes I have, but 

### Things I wish I'd brought
There's a couple of things I wish I'd brought – but to be honest, they've been fairly easy to find abroad.

**Cups/re-useable bottle** – in some AirBnB places we've stayed in, they only had tiny water glasses. In most places we've ended up buying big bottles and refilling them, but we bought two medium-sized plastic tumblers to take around in case we needed a bigger drink. They come in handy in hotel rooms, too!

**More bad shirts** – I brought all my favourite shirts. Maybe this is just me, but I feel weird wearing my favourite stuff every day. They're already starting to get a little tatty. I wish I had some more simple shirts that I could easily throw away at the end of this trip.

### Things I wish I'd left

**So many contact lenses** – I really overpacked for contact lenses. I guess I thought I'd be wearing my sunglasses more often?

**Running shorts** – yeah, that was wishful thinking.

**Three shirts** – (a.k.a. dress shirts or button-downs) I just don't wear these as much as I thought I would. I brought one ironable shirt and two non. I just don't wear the ironable one because it's too much hassle. I think one shirt would be plenty.

Summer is wrapping up in Europe and I'm starting to wear my heavier clothes again. But for a while, when it was 30ºC-plus every day in Prague, I cursed myself for bringing a woolen jumper and a heavy cardigan. Much like in a few months, I will probably be wondering why I brought shorts (although I did wear them a bunch!).

### Things I'm *so* glad I brought

**T-Mobile SIM card** – I can't sing the praises of (the USA company) T-Mobile enough. They have unlimited 3G data and texts for a large number of countries, and we switched to them just before we left the USA. Being able to use Google Maps, or check your e-mail, without having to worry about paying through the nose for every single megabyte is incredibly relieving.
