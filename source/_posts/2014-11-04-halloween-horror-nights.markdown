Halloween Horror Nights isn't *that* scary. We've found that smaller, local events are far scarier. Scare-actors at Universal Studios can't touch you. You move through the houses in a giant conga-line, rather than small groups.

With that said, Universal puts so much money into these houses that they're above and beyond anything you'll see at another horror event. The mazes are detailed and, for those based on films or TV shows, often amazingly accurate.

This year's event was a blast.
