Czech trains website (more on the trip back later)

One ticket for Ossuary/Cathedral of Assumption of Our Lady/Church of St Barbara (can also include Jesuit, but not open on Mondays)

Ossuary was neat

Assumption of Our Lady less so

Walk into town was not cool

Wandering around the back streets was fun

St Barbara's was lovely, great view

Train back from Kutná Hora město – not a good idea. 2hrs back.
