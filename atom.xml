    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We spent a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and I really recommend checking the conference out. Although I&rsquo;ve been to Sweden once before, I&rsquo;ve never been to Stockholm so I was pretty excited to check out this new city.</p>

<p>Stereotypes about Sweden that are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s cold – it was summer but it was 18ºC most days</li>
<li>everything is expensive</li>
<li>people wear brightly-coloured trousers (was that just a stereotype I had?)</li>
</ul>


<p>I like Sweden a lot. It&rsquo;s far more multicultural than I first expected (I had images of streets and streets filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed Scandanavians). Stockholm isn&rsquo;t as tourist-y as the last few places we&rsquo;ve been, either. It was refreshing at dinner to hear people around you speaking Swedish rather than English.</p>

<p>We only really had time for one day of touring, and when Hampton and I tour a city, we take it seriously. We looked up the top three things to do in Stockholm and made it a priority to check them off.</p>

<p>Stockholm is built on a bunch of islands – an archipelago, really. The centralmost island is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan">Gamla Stan</a>, &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo;. It has winding cobbled streets and alleyways and it&rsquo;s also the home of the royal palace. That&rsquo;s where we started our walking tour.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton looking over Gamla Stan</div>
</div>


<p></p>

<p>It was pretty, but full of tourist shops. We quickly headed over to the neighbouring island to check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Museet">Moderna Museet</a>. Although not as big as, say, MoMA or the Tate Modern, the collection is really good. It&rsquo;s manageable in size but also offers a great narrative over 20th century art.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Calder sculptures outside the museum</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we island hopped again – this time taking a ferry to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_museum">Vasa Museum</a>. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund">theme park</a> on the island – but it wasn&rsquo;t open. Sad times!</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)">Vasa</a> was a ship built in 1620s in preparation for a war against Poland. On its maiden voyage, it sank about 20 minutes after setting sail. It lay in the Stockholm bay for over 300 years, until it was recovered in the 1960s. It&rsquo;s still undergoing restoration and preservation, and it&rsquo;s housed in its own museum.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the largest intact boats on display from the 1600s, and it&rsquo;s in great shape.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Intricate carvings on the back of the Vasa</div>
</div>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s some areas of slightly lighter wood on the image above (the post on the top-left, and the cherub mid-right). Those are where the original carvings fell off and they re-carved them from new wood. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think that the rest of the carvings remained like that from when they were made in 1628.</p>

<p>Finally we headed back to the city centre (just north of gamla stan) for some food. We ate at a great Scandinavian restaurant called <a href="http://www.rolfskok.se/?lang=en">Rolf&rsquo;s Kök</a>. I had a super-rich ox cheek dish, and Hampton had a creamy fish stew. Both were delicious!</p>

  </a>

</div>


<p>After that, we realised that there was a <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/mikkeller-stockholm/">Mikkeller Bar</a> nearby. A Mikkeller Bar recently opened in San Francisco, but we never went. Why not go now, when we&rsquo;re half-way around the world?! So we went. I had a tasty IPA. Hampton tried asking the bartender if they had a British-style ale, but got a sassy reply, so had some wine instead.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Viking 25 IPA</div>
</div>


<p>As if to remind me how silly it was going to a bar that&rsquo;s in my home city, they had the <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/01/13/mikkeller-introduces-mission-chinese-food-beer/">Mission Chinese</a> lager on the board, too.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mission Chinese beer</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we tried to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail. Pro-tip: don&rsquo;t try to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail in Stockholm. Cocktails are extremely expensive (think $20 up). We ended up in a hotel bar and got an overly-sweet Manhattan that barely covered the bottom of the glass it was served in.</p>

<p><em>Having said that</em>, we did get a list of cocktail bar recommendations from someone in Stockholm. We&rsquo;ll have to go back, if only to do a local&rsquo;s tour. Most of them seemed to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6dermalm">Södermalm</a>, which is apparently the hipster area of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Anyway, we had a lot of fun in the city and I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving so soon. Like Vienna, I want to make a point of visiting again, and staying longer next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a flight back to England, where we&rsquo;ll be spending the late August bank holiday weekend. After that, it&rsquo;s Paris for a week then back to the USA! It&rsquo;s strange how quickly this time has gone – it seems like no time has passed since we left San Francisco. However, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of travel left – our trip moving south along the East Coast.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/20/markhalle-neun-and-sage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a great indoor market called <a href="http://www.markthalleneun.de/">Markthalle Neun</a> that&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=10953314371184579858&amp;q=Markthalle+Neun+GmbH&amp;ei=3sHwU4q8BLDQ7Aa4tYDgCg&amp;ved=0CL0BEPwSMA4">a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying</a>. It&rsquo;s not a traditional market in that there are people selling stuff every day. On a normal day there&rsquo;s a handful of stands or mini-kitchens selling locally-made food, wine, and other stuff.</p>

<p>On Thursdays, however, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;street food&rdquo; gathering where a lot more people show up. All the booths are filled with people selling their food – everything from pancakes to samosas to steamed buns. There&rsquo;s also a couple of food trucks outside, too. It gets incredibly packed, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s also a Sunday morning &ldquo;breakfast market,&rdquo; which has more of a focus on breakfast foods.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been to a couple of these events, but mostly we go on weekdays for lunch. There&rsquo;s such a wide variety of food there it&rsquo;s difficult to go wrong. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve taken pictures of pretty much everything I&rsquo;ve eaten there, so this will mainly be a bunch of pictures of delicious food.</p>

<p>The best thing I&rsquo;ve had so far has been the barbeque from <a href="http://www.bigstuff.de/">Big Stuff Smoked BBQ</a>. It blew away most of the BBQ I&rsquo;ve had in the USA.</p>

<p>There was a Vietnamese stall that did rice-stuffed rolls and some steamed buns.</p>

<p>There was a great vegetarian burger place. We accidentally went there because it had the shortest queue. Then we found out it was vegetarian, almost left, but stuck with it. The burger was so good! I think it was tofu or something, but it was mainly tasty cause they slathered it in peanut sauce.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The best veggie-burger I&#8217;ve ever had</div>
</div>


<p>The next place I went to, I had their veggie-burger but it sucked, so I went back to eating all meat all the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m English so I love savoury pies. What luck! There was a pie place in the market. I got a cheese and mince one and it was SO GOOD. I would eat ten more right now.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Cheese and mince pie (note: not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie">that kind of mince pie</a>, which would probably be gross with cheese in it)</div>
</div>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t like pies (like Hampton), you can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">reuben sandwich</a>! It had pastrami on it. Apparently this guy from Portland moved to Berlin and was upset he couldn&rsquo;t get decent pastrami&hellip; so he opened a deli!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fancy savoury items? Well there&rsquo;s a tonne of sweet stuff, too. There&rsquo;s a great waffle place.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Making waffles</div>
</div>


<p>Usually I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of waffles, but these were so good. Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Oh, and covered in caramel sauce.</p>

<p>The waffle place also did some crazy ice-creams&hellip;</p>

<p>And there was a lady selling ice-lollies (or &ldquo;popsicles&rdquo;).</p>

</div>


<p>OK, that&rsquo;s all my Markthalle photos. We did eat some fancy food as well – at <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a>. I really like the interior of this place. It&rsquo;s in a warehouse and has lots of industrial touches – like giant chains hanging from the ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also bright due to the large windows and white canvases on the walls.</p>

<p>We went for a four-course Chef&rsquo;s surprise menu. It was a great choice – full of interesting flavours and ingredients that I&rsquo;d never come across before. Here&rsquo;s some pictures:</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Lemon sorbet, chocolate-covered marscapone ice-cream</div>
</div>


<p>It was super-tasty and you should definitely go if you&rsquo;re in the area. Get an apéritif on the beach beforehand!</p>

<p>Our time in Berlin is almost over, and next we&rsquo;ll be heading off to Stockholm for <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-17T14:39:07+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/17/drinking-around-kreuzberg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I say &ldquo;around Kreuzberg,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a little misleading as we haven&rsquo;t really managed to explore the whole area. Berlin is pretty massive – more like London than Paris or New York. It&rsquo;s not that easy to walk to other areas (although we did take a nice stroll over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a> a couple of times).</p>

<p>As you are probably aware, Hampton and I scouted out as many cocktail bars as we could as soon as we arrived. For the past two weeks, we&rsquo;ve been slowly venturing further from our apartment to test out other places. Here&rsquo;s our list (and <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zSa_dTkSRnX0.kH2Fqz02A-M4">a handy map</a>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why, but there&rsquo;s a cocktail bar named after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir">noted American environmentalist</a>: <a href="http://johnmuirberlin.com/">John Muir</a>. To be honest, I only knew about him because I&rsquo;ve made a couple of day trips up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muir_Woods_National_Monument">Muir Woods</a>.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Bar area – it&#8217;s a little dark as it&#8217;s in a half-cellar</div>
</div>


<p>The inside is all exposed brick, with a couple of naturalist touches (like some stuffed animals). It&rsquo;s nice and cosy (but the bathrooms are disco-themed??). They have a regularly-rotating drinks menu and their custom drinks are <em>really</em> good. I got the Lightning Bug, which was a citrus-gin thing with some other delicious extras (honey and lillet, I think?).</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Lightning bug and a manhattan</div>
</div>


<p>I tried a couple of other cocktails on offer, and they were also excellent. It was strange that it never seemed to get too busy. Most people ordered beer or wine, and I wanted to shout at them because the cocktails were so tasty. Overall: 8.0/10</p>

<p>Not far from John Muir is <a href="">Kirk Bar</a>. Again, not really sure why it&rsquo;s named that. Star Trek reference, maybe? Nerds.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/drinks/kirk-bar.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Inside Kirk Bar</div>
</div>


<p>The inside is pretty bad-ass. It has a real crumbling old-timey feel, with a patina most bars wish they could get. Beautiful cornicing and high ceilings. The first time we went, I was pretty drunk so I&rsquo;m not sure what I ordered. I think it was a gin sour – but I remember thinking it was good.</p>

<p>When we came back, I was more sober and remembered my drink order – a Hemingway sour. It was the same as a regular gin sour, but with grenadine added. (I thought Hemingway liked rum?)</p>

</div>


<p>Overall: 7.6/10</p>

<p>I talked briefly about <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a> <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/13/berlin-how-do-you-think-it-feels/">in my previous post</a> – it&rsquo;s the bar on the water. Well, there&rsquo;s also a restaurant in a warehouse building just inland from the beach area. I&rsquo;ll talk about the food in another post, but I had a pretty amazing cocktail there. It was called the London garden and looked like a juice drink I&rsquo;d find in San Francisco.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">London Garden</div>
</div>


<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too sweet or too savoury, and it had the right amount of texture to it. It was so much more drinkable than those juices you find. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that it had alcohol in it or maybe it&rsquo;s&hellip; no, it was definitely the alcohol. Overall: 7.2/10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.homes-berlin.de/">Homes</a> was a little further away from our place, but we&rsquo;d read good reviews so we made the trek. It was decorated more like a casual coffee shop than a bar – it was very open, with low seating and &ldquo;cool&rdquo; murals on the walls.</p>

<div class="img">

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a little unfair for me to be that dismissive – we were there pretty early for Berlin drinking time. Berlin is a very late city – people only consider going to a bar or club at midnight. I&rsquo;m happy to be in bed by then. It also means that bars are pretty empty around 7pm which means (yay) there&rsquo;s usually little wait but (boo) we&rsquo;re usually the only people in there.</p>

<p>Anyway, the drinks at Homes were passable. I got a gin-cacao-lillet thing that tasted way better than the ingredients list suggested.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Gin-cacao-lillet</div>
</div>


<p>I was a little underwhelmed. Overall: 6.5/10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yelp.de/biz/schwarze-traube-berlin">Schwarze Traube</a> (&ldquo;black grape&rdquo;) was our first cocktail bar when we arrived. It&rsquo;s less than a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying and it had really good reviews. I was pretty excited.</p>

<p>The door has a sign saying you have to &ldquo;knock and smile&rdquo; to enter, which I did. The bartender was <em>not</em> happy to see us. She kind of pointed at some seats before going back behind the bar. The place is pretty small – two or three tiny rooms. The decor is great, though, with lots of fraying antique chairs and side-tables.</p>

<p>The bartender came over and told us they had a gin-based special drink. I ordered that one, and Hampton ordered a manhattan (which elicited a big sigh from the bartender). I like the idea of a no-menu, bartender-curated drinks list but only if the bartender is nice. Anyway, the drinks came after about fifteen minutes (which was weird, as we were the only people in there). They were really bloody good, and served in equisite, delicate glassware.</p>

<p>After we&rsquo;d finished our drinks, we had to wait another twenty minutes of the bartender disappearing and/or ignoring our requests for the bill. Great cocktails, but not really worth the lacklustre service. Overall: 5.6</p>

    <updated>2014-08-13T13:17:16+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/13/berlin-how-do-you-think-it-feels</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIofRTmTYVc">Title from Lou Reed&rsquo;s album, Berlin</a>)</p>

<p>Berlin doesn&rsquo;t feel European, and it&rsquo;s not quite like anywhere else Hampton and I have visited. It doesn&rsquo;t really seem to fit any classification, there&rsquo;s so much about it that&rsquo;s unique. I get that other cities have unique qualities. Paris has&hellip; <em>Parisian</em> things about it that make it unique – but it still feels European. Berlin does not. Maybe it&rsquo;s because  of its recent tumultuous history. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the idea of &ldquo;Europeanness&rdquo; includes Paris, and London, and Rome, but somehow left out Berlin. For whatever reason, it&rsquo;s an alluring city that we made a point of returning to.</p>

<p>Last time we visited Berlin, we stayed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenzlauer_Berg">Prenzlauer Berg</a>, a hip ex-East Berlin neighbourhood in the north of the city. This time, we chose to stay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a>.</p>

<p>Along with Prenzlauer Berg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a>, Kreuzberg is considered to be the trendier, less-polished side of the city. Although technically in West Berlin during the separation of Germany, Kreuzberg was on the eastern edge of the city, so was relatively underdeveloped. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, all three neighbourhoods have undergone varying levels of gentrification.</p>

<p>Coming from the obvious beauty of Prague or Amsterdam, Berlin was a little brutal. On our block, there are multiple featureless, indistinguishable mid-1970s apartment complexes. They&rsquo;re covered in graffiti and look pretty drab.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Typical Kreuzberg apartment building</div>
</div>


<p>So far, I&rsquo;m probably not painting a great picture of Berlin, am I? The thing that really draws Hampton and me to the city is the people and the atmosphere. I&rsquo;d call it artistic or care-free; I&rsquo;m sure an American could equally describe it as entrepreneurial. Confused? Let me try and describe an example.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re staying just off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree">Spree</a>. It&rsquo;s a little industrial along our side of the river, with brick warehouses and lots of gates. We saw some place recommended on FourSquare along the river, but weren&rsquo;t that sure where it was. After walking through what looked like a gate to an industrial estate, we saw a couple of shipping containers stacked on top of each other with a 1970s car on top.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/sage-bar-entry.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Shipping container garden</div>
</div>


<p>As you continue walking towards the bank of the river, you see a makeshift beach.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Sage Bar – a beach</div>
</div>


<p>And there&rsquo;s this wonderful bar, hidden away, popular at all times of the day. Kids are running around playing in their sand as their tattooed, mid-thirties parents sip an Aperol and soda. There&rsquo;s grey-haired couples drinking tall beers, reading books. And right across the river is one of the longest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery">still-standing stretches of the Berlin Wall</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/sage-bar-view.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">View over the Spree and the Berlin Wall</div>
</div>


<p>Berlin is such a strange mixture of rule-following, energy, and laissez-faireness. People are frenetic and excited on the streets, playing loud music and drinking and rushing to the next bar&hellip; before languishing the next morning over a three-hour brunch. It takes a while to get used to, but it&rsquo;s something that I find very energising and disruptive.</p>

<p>One of the strangest moments so far was going for karaoke with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI">Travis CI</a> folks. The karaoke bar was just across the river from Kreuzberg, in Friedrichshain. To get there, we walked along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberbaum_Bridge">Oberbaum bridge</a>, which used to be an East-West border crossing.</p>

<p>We then walked past a stretch of the Berlin Wall, which was turned into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery">open-air gallery</a> soon after the unification of Germany.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/east-side-gallery.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/east-side-gallery.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The East Side Gallery</div>
</div>


<p>The gallery itself is really neat, and on a separate occasion we took a longer stroll along it.</p>

<p>Anyway, we got to karaoke, sang a few songs, drank a few beers. Then someone put on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_song)">&ldquo;Heroes&rdquo;</a> by David Bowie. Recorded in the 1970s in Berlin, it&rsquo;s about two lovers who can&rsquo;t be together: one is from East Berlin, and one is from West Berlin.</p>

<p>And there we were, singing about the horror of the wall, in a karaoke bar about 500ft away, having just crossed an ex-border crossing.</p>

<p>Above all, Berlin is wonderful and strange.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/09/amsterdam-food</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We visited a couple of great cocktail bars while in Amsterdam. The first was <a href="http://www.door-74.com/">Door 74</a>. You need to phone up to get a reservation, but we did that literally minutes before knocking on the door, and they had a table.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/drinks/door-74.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Unassuming door</div>
</div>


<p>The menu was neat. I got the impression it was seasonal, as it was heavily themed on 60s sci-fi despite the bar not having anything remotely about that. They had a few drinks from every planet. Each drink had a ray-gun indicator next to it showing how strong the drink was.</p>

<div class="img">

<p>Our friend got the special, some blend of vodka and fruit juice that was served in a tiki container. It was poured at the table, which was neat.</p>

  <div class="alt">Tezuka&#8217;s Lost World</div>
</div>


<p>The other place we enjoyed was <a href="http://njoycocktails.com/">NJoy</a>. It&rsquo;s slightly odd – there&rsquo;s lots of neon lighting and trying-hard-to-be-hip furniture, like a scene out of Sex and the City.</p>

<p>The menu was arranged into pretentious categories – each a supposed personality type. Are you an Alchemist or a Trendsetter? A Dreamer or a Connoisseur? The drinks were all novel and had some really interesting combinations of flavours. The bartenders were really friendly and the drinks were well-made and delicious – and that&rsquo;s why we kept coming back.</p>

<p>A word of warning: NJoy is located on &ldquo;restaurant row&rdquo; (Leidsedwarsstraat). It&rsquo;s full of possibly the most pushy restaurants I&rsquo;ve ever walked past. In super-touristy areas, I&rsquo;m used to people asking, &ldquo;You looking for a place to eat? We have delicious steak!&rdquo; and me ignoring them. This was a whole other level. People hold menus in your face, they block your way, they won&rsquo;t let you past unless you&rsquo;ve responded to them. Our tactic to avoid this as best as we could was to appear to be in a heated debate as we rapidly walked the gauntlet.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto food. When travelling, I enjoy eating the local food. <a href="https://twitter.com/roy">Roy</a>, our Dutch friend who met us on our first night in Amsterdam, explained that there&rsquo;s not much that&rsquo;s considered Dutch cuisine. It&rsquo;s mostly French food or German. Anyway, we tried our best and visited <a href="http://www.thepantry.nl/">The Pantry</a>. They called themselves Dutch cuisine, so hey, let&rsquo;s give it a go.</p>

<p>I got a trio of what were essentially mashed potatoes with other stuff in them. In the picture below, starting from the top and going clockwise, there&rsquo;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zuurkoolstamppot (sauerkraut)</li>
<li>Hustpot (beef, carrots, onions)</li>
<li>Boerenkoolstamppot (kale)</li>
</ul>


<p>(with a meatball in the middle)</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mashed potatoes</div>
</div>


<p>The sauerkraut one was the best. Nom nom.</p>

<p>The other thing that seemed to be everywhere was pancakes. We went to a pancake place and saw they had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poffertjes">poffertjes</a> – a kind of cross between beignets and American-style pancakes. They were served with butter and icing sugar. Very healthy.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Poffertjes</div>
</div>


<p>We went for a memorable meal at a steak and ribs place – <a href="http://www.castellamsterdam.nl/en/">Castell</a>. We made a reservation, showed up on time, and the waiter showed us to our table. We were a little confused. Rather than a regular dining table, it was coffee table-height, and our seats were leather benches surrounding one end (another group was at the other end).</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/food/steak-table.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Our table (we ordered some escargot)</div>
</div>


<p>We weren&rsquo;t quite sure whether this was a pre-dinner drink table or what. But soon we received some wicker trays, one per person, on which to eat our steaks.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/food/steak-lap.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/food/steak-lap.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton with his tray</div>
</div>


<p>I got the ribs, and Hampton got a steak. They came on wooden blocks with little copper pans of sauce, and were delivered onto our trays. Eating was challenging, to say the least. There was no real space to put your tray if you needed to get up. I couldn&rsquo;t really reach my drink without my shirt getting ribs all over it. It was <em>not</em> easy.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> (and it&rsquo;s a big one) – those ribs were amazing. No, seriously – possibly the best ribs I&rsquo;ve ever had (and I&rsquo;ve spent time in the South). The meat was tender, falling off the bone, and had a crisp char. The rub they used had just the right balance of vinegar, spice, and sugar. I&rsquo;d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYsLh4QjBPc#t=16">step over my own mother</a> for those ribs.</p>

<p>Something we noticed in Amsterdam – the service is slow. Exceptionally slow. Even taking into account European-style service (which we&rsquo;re both fine with!), Amsterdam added an extra level to that. Not sure why, but there you go.</p>

<p>Anyway, now we&rsquo;re in Berlin for a couple of weeks. We&rsquo;re staying in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a> district, so stay tuned for posts about that.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/04/amsterdam-museums/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-04T15:36:21+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/04/amsterdam-museums</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We toured the four main museums in Amsterdam: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank_House">Anne Frank House</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a>. For the first three Hampton&rsquo;s Dad bought tickets beforehand – which I&rsquo;d highly recommend doing as the lines looked hellish. For the last one, Hampton and I rolled up at 4pm on a Sunday (with closing time at 6pm) and waltzed right in.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Rijksmuseum, canal-side</div>
</div>


<p>The Rijksmuseum has recently undergone a huge rennovation, re-opening in April 2013. It certainly shows – the internal atrium is beautiful and the layout is intuitive. <strong>Pro-tip</strong>: don&rsquo;t pay €5 for the museum audio guide! The museum has a free app for iPhone/iPod – with all the same information on it. Use that instead! They even have free wi-fi in the museum if you forget to download it before you get there.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum-atrium.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum-atrium.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Rijksmuseum atrium</div>
</div>


<p>The app offers a 90-minute &ldquo;highlights&rdquo; tour, which we did. I could have spent more time in the Dutch masters area (on the second floor) – the highlights tour only looked at a couple of paintings there. The impressionist and romantic areas were a little less exciting.</p>

<p>The museum itself is <em>packed</em>. Admittedly, we are in the middle of tourist season, but I expected it to be slightly quieter on a Monday. It was difficult to get a peaceful moment with any painting – but I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when a museum is closed for a while and it&rsquo;s also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_art_museums_in_the_world">19th most visited museum in the world</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of super-famous paintings on the tour, the most famous being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch">Night Watch</a> by Rembrandt. Of course, it was in an insanely-crowded room. It was pretty easy to get close, though.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum-nightwatch.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/rijksmuseum-nightwatch.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Who watches the Night Watch?</div>
</div>


<p>The information cards they had were really useful. They circle particular elements of the painting, drawing out background figures or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch#Acts_of_vandalism">where someone slashed the painting</a>.</p>

<p>I also really liked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milkmaid_(Vermeer)">The Milkmaid</a> by Vermeer. I could have spent a while looking at that painting. The rest of the museum was a little repetetive, especially the ground floor, which had a lot of medieval carvings.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Please show me to Carcosa, creepy chandelier lady</div>
</div>


<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> was quite different from what I was expecting. There was a heavy emphasis on his development as an artist and his interaction with contemporaries.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/van-gogh-museum.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/van-gogh-museum.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The Van Gogh Museum</div>
</div>


<p>I was prepared to see gallery after gallery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)">sunflowers</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)">olive trees</a>, but in fact there was a lot more range in his style than I had previously thought. There were a number of Japanese-influenced paintings which had some aspect of the Van Gogh style I knew, but in a completely different context. There were also a lot of muted paintings, absent of his usually vivid palette – one of a bird&rsquo;s nest in particular stood out.</p>

<p>Being fans of contemporary art, it&rsquo;s probably no surprise that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a> was our favourite. The building has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam#mediaviewer/File:Stedelijk_Museum_1.jpg">giant bathtub-shaped</a> entrance, which is awesome. All the walls inside are painted white, and going from the ground floor to the first floor is a mesmerising experience – there&rsquo;s neon art all around the upstairs atrium, so you walk into a glowing otherworld.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/stede-atrium.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Going up to the first floor</div>
</div>


<p>On some of the columns downstairs, there&rsquo;s a cool set of porcelain plates by John Knight. They&rsquo;re from the Autotypes series. Each one has a blueprint of an extension to a city&rsquo;s modern art museum. They reduce the buildings to nothing but floor plans, and we both loved them. I want some for our house.</p>

  <div class="alt">Autotypes, John Knight</div>
</div>


<p>Downstairs traces modern art from 1900-1950, whereas upstairs does 1950-present day. The art is mostly displayed chronologically, and they had some great unfamiliar pieces by famous artists. I love seeing new works by great artists (maybe that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;greatest hits&rdquo; style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art">MoMA</a>?).</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Stunning and bold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein</a></div>
</div>


<p>As well as contemporary art, there was a large section of the museum devoted to design. There were lots of fun household items from the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>There was also <a href="http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/the-gijsemmy-spectacle">a special exhibition/retrospective on Gijs+Emmy</a>, a couple who revolutionised jewelry in the 1960s. One of their first exhibitions was in the museum, and it was neat seeing videos of their models back then. Their necklaces were more like cowls than dainty chains, obscuring most of the model&rsquo;s face.</p>

</div>


<p>The museum had a lot of works that seemed to be crafted for them specifically. It was nice catching glimpses of how the museum itself had fitted into the history of modern art – a self-awareness that&rsquo;s lacking in a lot of museums.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank_House">Anne Frank House</a> is in the west of Amsterdam, and you should definitely pre-purchase tickets. The line to get in was about an hour long, even at night. We had timed tickets and didn&rsquo;t have to wait at all for our 8pm slot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl">The Diary of a Young Girl</a> before, so I started it in preparation for visiting the house. I&rsquo;m certainly glad I did – it made the house much more atmospheric. It was strange reading the diary and later on that day seeing quotes on the walls from the diary itself, or reading the actual page on which she wrote that entry.</p>

<p>Inside the house, you can&rsquo;t take photos. But it was incredibly well-preserved. You walk through the old warehouse and offices in the front of the building, through a secret bookcase (the <em>actual bookcase</em> that was built in 1942 for the purpose of obscuring the hiding place) and into the annex. I was expecting an attic, but the living space was split over two floors and certainly more of an &ldquo;annex&rdquo; to the main house.</p>

<p>In Anne&rsquo;s room, she had glued pictures onto the wall from a magazine she used to have. The pictures were still there – it looked like a normal child&rsquo;s room. There were marks on the wall measuring how tall Anne and her sister had become over their two years in hiding. It was incredibly moving seeing remnants of a life that you knew didn&rsquo;t end well.</p>

<p>There were also exhibits on the diary itself (the <em>actual</em> diary she wrote in) and her father&rsquo;s role in getting it published. Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Frank">Anne&rsquo;s father</a> and the people who helped keep the annex a secret lived long after the war, and helped to put together the museum. There are video clips of them talking about their experiences, which adds an extra level to the museum.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can say I <em>enjoyed</em> the museum, but it was deeply humbling and emotional. Definitely a must-do if you&rsquo;re in Amsterdam.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was always a little ashamed that I&rsquo;d never visited Amsterdam. It&rsquo;s only a short flight from London and people always list it as a highlight of Europe. Hampton&rsquo;s parents were in Amsterdam for a week, so we decided to join them and find out what all the fuss was about.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Houses along the canal, a bridge, and cyclists</div>
</div>


<p>In a lot of ways, Amsterdam was exactly what I was expecting. Canals criss-crossed with beautiful bridges, cyclists going far too fast.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton and his Dad as we wandered around the canals</div>
</div>


<p>We decided to do a walking tour on foot. We stayed near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidseplein">Leidseplein</a>, and walking all the way to the center took about 40 minutes. We walked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_Square">Dam Square</a>, the centre of the city. It was nice, but touristy. You had to pay to go in the church or the palace, and we skipped both of them.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/dam-palace.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/dam-palace.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Royal Palace in Dam</div>
</div>


<p>What I would recommend is taking a canal boat around the city. We used the <a href="https://www.canal.nl/en/canal-bus">Canal Bus</a>, which is advertised as a hop-on/hop-off tour. However we just used it to see the city from another angle.</p>

<p>It stopped at most of the standard things – Dam Square, the Anne Frank House, Rembrandt&rsquo;s House, etc. – but it was nice to see some other bits of the city. In particular, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EYE_Film_Institute_Netherlands">Eye Film Institute</a> had a beautiful building.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/eyefilm.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/eyefilm.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Eye Film Institute</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(Amsterdam)">IJ</a> (the main waterfront of Amsterdam) from most of the city, and it&rsquo;s something we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen by just walking.</p>

<p>Another pro-tip: walk around at dusk. Especially in the summer, it&rsquo;s so relaxed and the houses look inviting. There are often people having parties on boats and people dining along the canals.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Dusk over houses</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a lot more to the city than hookers and weed (although you can find those in certain areas if you must).</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/30/anonymous-bar-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>Our time in Prague is almost at an end – today, we&#8217;re taking a flight to Amsterdam. We saved an intriguing bar for our last new experience in the cocktail world of Prague. <a href="http://www.anonymousbar.cz/cs"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">AnonymouS Bar</span></a> (their weird capitalisation, not mine) is off a small alley in the old town, and it is themed around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot">gunpowder plot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta">V for Vendetta</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a> movement.</p>

  <p>Inside, the bar is styled like the interior of V&#8217;s hideout in the comic book/film. It allows the use of comfortable chairs, but also brick-showing-through-plaster murals and classic portraits with faces replaced by the Guy Fawkes mask. It kind of reminded us (in the best way possible, as we&#8217;re theme park nerds) of a Universal Studios or Disney experience.</p>

  <p>The menu has a really great concept: a list of standard drinks on one page, paired up with an AnonymouS-bar twist on the classics. It was a goodway to quickly pick out a drink you&#8217;d be sure to like. I went for the St Marry&#8217;s Virus – again, that&#8217;s their weird spelling, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s deliberate or not. It was a twist on the Piccadilly martini. The bartender came over with a biohazard box, which opened to reveal a giant syringe containing the cocktial.</p>

    </a>

  </div>

  <p>Hampton went for a take on a gimlet, and it was really delicious! I think they added cucumber and some other stuff.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">M. Butterfly</div>
  </div>

  <p>The menu, aside from the drink and liquor list, was pretty entertaining. They had neat explanation of their thought process behind the concept. As I was flicking through, I noticed there was a cocktail set apart from the rest, alone on the very first page. It didn&#8217;t have a description, aside from the old rhyme: &#8220;Remember, remember the fifth of November&#8230;&#8221; It was too puzzling not to get.</p>

  <p>Hampton got it after me, so I have photos of what it entailed. The bartender handed you a Guy Fawkes mask and took your photo.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">They had to find more film</div>
  </div>

  <p>After that, they make the drink. It involved lining a brandy snifter with liquor and setting it on fire. Once the fire had died down, they poured in a whisky-based old-fashioned-esque cocktail. They placed the photo on top to stop the smoke from the flames coming out.</p>

  <p>Here are the photos of our night. It&#8217;s nice to have something to keep after a night out. Especially once you&#8217;ve had a few cocktails.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/27/la-degustation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p><a href="http://www.ladegustation.cz/en/#index"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">La Degustation</span></a>, one of two restaurants in Prague to have <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurants/Restaurants-Prague-_-Praha_hlavni_mesto-Czech_Republic?strLocid=31MzhkeDEwY05UQXVNRGczT0RFPWNNVFF1TkRJd05EWT0=">a Michelin star</a>, was our special treat as our time in Prague is coming to an end. Its slogan is &#8220;bohême bourgeoise,&#8221; which I found amusing.</p>

  <p>Inside, I don&#8217;t know if anything can be gothic minimalist, but I think that&#8217;s an accurate description. Arches ribbed the ceiling, and artfully-placed dim spotlights created wonderful shadows. The walls were bare and painted a light grey, and the furniture was all low-backed and dark wood. The windows onto the street had the restaurant&#8217;s signature checkered pattern.</p>

  <p>As we sat down, the waiter came over and gave us an envelope.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Two menu options</div>
  </div>

  <p>We went for the eleven-course menu, with wine pairings. It was definitely a lot of food, and I wish I hadn&#8217;t eaten so much of the delicious bread they brought. The menu focussed on Czech ingredients and dishes, but with modern, vaguely molecular-gastronomic twists. Apparently a lot of the inspiration for their dishes comes from a late-19th century Czech cookbook.</p>

  <p>I didn&#8217;t take pictures and I won&#8217;t bore you with a course-by-course detailing of everything. A couple of stand-out dishes, though: dijon mustard ice-cream with hot tomato sauce. The sauce was the perfect distillation of tomato flavour. Add that to the mustard (which wasn&#8217;t too spicy), plus the mixing of the hot sauce with the cold ice-cream and you get an incredible dish that&#8217;s not quite like anything I&#8217;ve had before.</p>

  <p>There was a foie gras course where the liver had been finely grated over wine jelly and pistachio. I&#8217;d never eaten foie gras grated before, and it really helped take away the heaviness you sometimes get. Then there was the beef tongue &#8220;signature dish.&#8221; </p>

  <p>I really enjoyed the wine pairings. They used mostly Czech wines, and it was nice to see the variety in types they produce here. There was also a great unfiltered Slovenian wine called <a href="http://www.scurek.com/www/index.php/en/wines/white-wines">Kontra</a>. The cheese course came with a delicious IPA from the <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23493/">Matuška Brewery</a>.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">If you&#8217;re willing to splash out, this place is definitely worth it. It&#8217;s a modern take on Czech flavours and ingredients, and the courses are presented beautifully.</span></p>

    <updated>2014-07-25T11:58:05+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/25/jewish-quarter-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josefov">Jewish Quarter</a> (or Josefov) of Prague is in the Old Town, just north of the Old Town Square. We&rsquo;d been told that the <a href="http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/apinkas.htm">Pinkas Synagogue</a> was a must-see, so we set off on a visit without learning much about it. All I knew was that it&rsquo;s now a memorial to victims of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">Holocaust</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Pinkas Synagogue from the outside</div>
</div>


<p>We arrived at lunchtime and the queue was really long and slow-moving. Not good.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-queue.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-queue.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Long queue waiting for tickets</div>
</div>


<p>However! We found an EXPERT WORK-AROUND for buying tickets without having to wait in line. Head slightly east on the same road and take the first left. You&rsquo;ll find <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maiselova+38%2F15,+110+00+Praha-Praha+1,+Czech+Republic/@50.089592,14.4181715,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b94e8669ff2a5:0xb73abb80fc435169">a ticketing office</a>.</p>

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ticket-office.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Just around the corner – under 2 mins walk.</div>
</div>


<p>There was no queue and we got our tickets immediately. You can&rsquo;t buy a single ticket to see the synagogues/museums of Josefov individually – you have to buy a multi-attraction ticket. The most basic ticket was 300Kč (~$15) for four attractions: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_Cemetery,_Prague">Old Jewish Cemetery</a>, the <a href="http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/aklaus.htm">Klausen Synagogue</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Ceremonial_Hall,_Prague">Ceremonial Hall</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Synagogue_(Prague)">Spanish Synagogue</a>. You could pay 100Kč more if you wanted to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_New_Synagogue,_Prague">Old New Synagogue</a>, but we gave that one a miss. The ticket is valid over seven days, though, which is good if you don&rsquo;t have enough time to visit all the places in one day.</p>

<p>After we bought our tickets we went back to the Pinkas Synagogue and sailed past the line there to buy tickets.</p>

<p>The inside of the Pinkas Synagogue serves as a memorial to the 80,000 Bohemian and Moravian Jews that were victims of the Holocaust.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-room.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-room.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Inside the synagogue</div>
</div>


<p>There were about five rooms like the one above – and see those red and black, floor-to-ceiling patches that line the walls? Those are the victims&#8217; names, birth-dates and death-dates. Across the rooms they&rsquo;re written out like that, in letters maybe a centimetre high.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-names.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-names.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Names, births and deaths of victims</div>
</div>


<p>At first, you don&rsquo;t quite understand it. Then as you start reading, seeing the families grouped together, it&rsquo;s a little overwhelming. Especially when you see room after room of them. It was powerful stuff, and something I&rsquo;d recommend everyone do while they&rsquo;re in Prague.</p>

<p>After exiting the synagogue, you walk through the Old Jewish Cemetery. While not that large geographically, it apparently contains over 12,000 tombstones.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/cemetery.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Old Jewish Cemetery</div>
</div>


<p>Needless to say, it was crowded with graves. The tombstones stuck out at all kinds of angles, and many were only just sticking out of the soil.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Another view of the cemetery</div>
</div>


<p>The cemetary exit leaves you just outside of Ceremonial Hall and the Klausen Synagogue. As we already had the multi-ticket, we decided to give them a visit.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ceremonial-hall.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ceremonial-hall.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ceremonial Hall tiled floor</div>
</div>


<p>The Ceremonial Hall used to be a kind of mortuary, so had a bunch of exhibits on the rituals surrounding death in Judaism. It was kind of interesting, but mostly just items in display cases.</p>

<p>The Klausen Synagogue was similar. Apart from the Pinkas Synagogue earlier on, I&rsquo;d never been inside a synagogue before. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I was expecting from the inside of a synagogue, but I was kind of disappointed that it looked just like a Christian church.</p>

<p>Inside the main area of the Klausen Synagogue, there were display cases showing items relating to Judaism. I found it a little strange. I almost wanted the museum part and the religious-building part to be more separate. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to be so much of a museum.</p>

<p>After leaving the Klausen Synagogue, the route to the next stop on our ticket took us past the Old New Synagogue. I only learnt afterwards that it&rsquo;s Europe&rsquo;s oldest active synagogue. Apparently, its attic is also the storage place for the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague">Golem of Prague</a> (<em>spooky noises</em>).</p>

  </a>

</div>


<p>We continued walking, made a couple of quick turns, and found ourselves at the Spanish Synagogue. Not much to look at from the outside, inside it&rsquo;s absolutely stunning.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Spanish Synagogue interior</div>
</div>


<p>The walls are covered in intricate patterns, mostly using reds and golds. The Star of David appears in motifs everywhere, and I spent ages just following the patterns and their interplay across the walls. The central dome is beautiful and has a Star of David-shaped chandelier in the centre.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish-dome.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Dome of the Spanish Synagogue</div>
</div>


<p>Fun fact: it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be clear why it&rsquo;s called the Spanish Synagogue. One theory is that the interior design reminded people of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain">&ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo;</a> of Judaism in Spain. Another theory is that it used to be a location for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaniotes">Byzantine Jewish</a> worship, and that led to legends of the Iberian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> once worshipping there.</p>

<p>Like the Klausen Synagogue, the Spanish Synagogue is a museum as well as a religious building. I was mostly distracted by the detailing on the walls, but I did look at a couple of the display cases in the upper balconies. They were pretty interesting, detailing the history of Josefov across the centuries. If it hadn&rsquo;t been over 30ºC in there, I would have stayed longer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad we ended up seeing more of the Jewish Quarter than just the Pinkas Synagogue, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d see the Klausen Synagogu and the Ceremonial Hall if I were pushed for time. I definitely found it more rewarding than most of Prague Castle, though. I made a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Maiselova+38%2F15,+110+00+Praha,+Czech+Republic/Pinkas+Synagogue,+%C5%A0irok%C3%A1+23%2F3,+110+00+Praha,+Czech+Republic/Klausov%C3%A1+synagoga,+U+star%C3%A9ho+h%C5%99bitova+3a,+110+00+Praha-Josefov,+Czech+Republic/The+Old-New+Synagogue,+Maiselova+18,+110+01+Praha+1,+Czech+Republic/50.0900973,14.4211259/@50.090032,14.4178231,18z/data=!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b94e8669ff2a5:0xb73abb80fc435169!2m2!1d14.4181715!2d50.089592!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b94e85e9af185:0x294f2ae19539722d!2m2!1d14.416972!2d50.089277!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b94e877e558db:0xdd1a2cc59bf35380!2m2!1d14.417069!2d50.09002!1m10!1m1!1s0x470b94e868e5c8c9:0x94be0e2fdb884bfa!2m2!1d14.418567!2d50.090051!3m4!1m2!1d14.4190562!2d50.0899754!3s0x470b94e844b3b4d3:0x32c184f0e15a1660!1m0!3e2">map of the route we took</a> – but note that the bit from the Pinkas to Klausen is through the cemetery rather than around Maiselova.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p><a href="http://www.orangebar.cz/en/homepage.html"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Orange Bar</span></a> is pretty close by to us and has decent reviews. It&#8217;s a little tricky to find, down a couple of side-streets, but there&#8217;s a nice orange-shaped sign outside to let you know when you&#8217;re there.</p>

  <div class="img">

  </div>

  <p>From the outside, it looks pretty normal, right? Inside, though, it reminded me of a bar in Dune or something. The only lights had orange filters, and all the walls were molded to give the appearance of being dug out of a cave.</p>

  <p>The bar shelves were all integrated into the back wall. The other walls had fake columns with cubbies for desert plants.</p>

  <p>The cocktail list leaned heavily towards rum-based beach drinks – mai tais, piña coladas, zombies etc. There&#8217;s also a good list of classics, too. Hampton went for (of course) a manhattan. I tried out the mai tai but it was a little too sweet for me.</p>

  <p>We were there during a massive thunderstorm and didn&#8217;t have umbrellas, so we stayed for another round (or two). The moscow mule was <em>much</em> better. Get that! It had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis_peruviana">physalis</a> garnish too, which is awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>For some reason, there&#8217;s a bar in Prague named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>, the American union leader who went missing in the 70s. Unfortunately, my lack of Czech skills (and poor Google translating) don&#8217;t help much with the &#8220;About&#8221; page on the <a href="http://hoffa.cz"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hoffa</span></a> website.</p>

  <p>First and foremost: this is a non-smoking bar! Yay! That automatically gets you points in my book. Most bars have smoking and non-smoking areas, but that&#8217;s not quite the same. Location-wise, it&#8217;s on a little intersection near the main train station (so great for people-watching), and has big windows. The decor is neat – they have a massive trompe-l&#8217;œil mural on one side so it looks like you&#8217;re in a warehouse.</p>

  <p>They have mostly traditional drinks, with some specials on a chalkboard. The drink I had was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I went for a glass of Pimm&#8217;s as it was ridiculously hot outside.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>After the underwhelming experience at <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/19/cloud-9-prague">Cloud 9</a>, I wanted to try out the bar at the other Prague-based Hilton: <a href="http://www.hiltonpragueoldtown.com/loungebar-en.html"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Zinc Lounge and Bar</span></a>, found in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+Prague+Old+Town/@50.088515,14.431864,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x63a407a250359dc7">Hilton Prague Old Town</a>. I wanted to see how it measured up, and in short: it was pretty bad. Please forgive me, Cloud 9, I didn&#8217;t realise your sister bar was so awful. I would have cut you some slack otherwise!</p>

  <p>The Hilton Prague Old Town is pretty easy to find compared with the other Hilton. It&#8217;s just off Náměstí Republiky, one of the main squares in the Old Town. The Zinc Bar and Lounge is just to the right as you come in. &#8220;Zinc&#8221; is also the name of the hotel restaurant, just behind the bar</p>

  <p>Inside, it&#8217;s decorated like a dreary hotel lobby. Leather seats and low, round wooden tables. Holey partitions of wood try to separate the actual hotel lobby from the bar. Despite their best efforts, we were still drinking around a bunch of people loudly chatting on Skype (I assume there&#8217;s free wi-fi in the lobby area) and wheeling their luggage around, waiting for their ride to the airport.</p>

  <div class="img">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Zinc Bar</div>
  </div>

  <p>The menu consisted almost entirely of classic cocktails. There was nothing inventive or fancy like at Cloud 9. We stuck to our staples and got a gimlet and a manhattan. They were both OK – competently done and similar to what you could find at a lot of bars in Prague.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Drinks: gimlet and a manhattan</div>
  </div>

  <p>The thing is, these cocktails were 220Kč (~$11) each. And there was me going off on how expensive the Cloud 9 cocktails were, at 185Kč (~$9)! Like I said in the beginning, I&#8217;M SORRY CLOUD 9. The Cloud 9 cocktails were far more reasonably-priced (I still think they&#8217;re expensive, though). At least you get something different, innovative. At Zinc you get a standard cocktail that at another bar (say, Groove Bar) would be 100Kč (~$5).</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Put together the atmosphere of the hotel lobby with the fact that the drinks were exceedinly expensive for what they were, and you get a disappointing experience. I&#8217;d suggest venturing a little out of the hotel to find a better cocktail bar.</span></p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/19/cloud-9-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p><a href="http://www.cloud9.cz/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Cloud 9</span></a> (or, in full, Cloud 9 Sky Bar & Lounge) is located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?safe=off&ie=UTF-8&fb=1&cid=4324379790027078551&q=Hilton+Prague+Hotel&ei=BVnGU-X9E-aV7Ab6loCQDQ&ved=0CMQBEPwSMAo">Hilton</a>, just east of the central Old Town district of Prague. It&#8217;s got pretty good reviews, most extolling the views over Prague. So, of course we had to go.</p>

  <p>Firstly: getting to the Hilton is surprisingly tricky. (<strong>NB</strong>: there are two Hiltons in Prague, the more central <a href="http://d1pa4et5htdsls.cloudfront.net/images/vfml/1/1/2/9/6/1/5/709926e0_prgothi_74095_s-original.jpg">Hilton Prague Old Town</a> and the <a href="http://www.hotels-in-czech.com/clfiles/photos/big/29-hilton-budova.jpg">Hilton Prague</a>. This is in the latter.) It&#8217;s strange how much Prague changes between the first and eighth districts. It quickly goes from windy cobblestone streets to broad roads and unfriendly pedestrian crossings. The Hilton itself takes up a whole square block, yet finding the right route to get there – even finding the right entrance to use – was confusing. We just about managed by following the tourists forming a trail on their way to the Old Town.</p>

  <p>Once you&#8217;ve found your way in (use the west entrance to the Hilton, and take a sharp right for the lift to the ninth floor), the views are the first thing that strike you. It was early evening as we came in, and the sun slowly setting gave some nice cloud patterns. However, I guess I was expecting more of a grand view of the <em>centre</em> of Prague. Instead, you get a beautiful view of the Allianz building next door.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">The view west, towards the centre of Prague</div>
  </div>

  <p>I suppose I&#8217;m being a little harsh – you can just see the top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Our_Lady_before_T%C3%BDn">Church of Our Lady before Týn</a> on the left. </p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">I found <span class="strike">Wally</span> the Church!</div>
  </div>

  <p>The north and east views are nicer – but more pastoral than the gothic spires I was imagining.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">The view north</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bar itself was decorated like a hotel bar. Clean lines, mirrors everywhere, leather-backed chairs. They had a couple of outside seating areas, but these were filled up with hotel guests.</p>

    <div class="alt">Interior of the bar.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Speaking of the clientele, I wasn&#8217;t too surprised to find it filled with tourists. It was early (7pm), the bar is tricky to find, and it&#8217;s a <em>hotel bar</em>, so you&#8217;re not going to get an authentic Czech experience. Even so, the groups of English/North American tourists asking the waitress to pronounce &#8220;Na zdraví!&#8221; (&#8220;Cheers!&#8221;) over and over was grating. But onto the cocktails!</p>

  <p>The menu was interesting, and had a good mix of classics plus some that had been made up in the bar. Their inventions all had new-agey, etherial names like SUNSHINE and MYSTIC and DESIRE. Their most famous cocktail (according to them, at least) is the CHARISMA.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/cloud9/charisma.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Charisma</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Charisma is so famous that it has intricate instructions for drinking.</p>

    <div class="alt">Instructions for drinking</div>
  </div>

  <p>Despite that, you still look like a wally drinking something with a giant chili pepper sticking out of it.</p>

  <p>My drinks weren&#8217;t nearly as exciting. They didn&#8217;t even have instructions on how to drink them. Sad times.</p>

    <div class="alt">Desire (the thumbs up is for size reference, not endorsement)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Mystic was a vodka-ginger-lime-sugar thing and was delicious. The Desire, on the other hand, tasted like what I imagine pot pourri tastes like (i.e. gross).</p>

  <p>The bar snacks were delicious. We never really found out what they were, due to the language barrier, but it seemed to be some kind of caramel-coated peanut in a crispy shell dusted in salt and dried tomato (? maybe). We scarfed them down in about five minutes.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The prices were pretty crazy. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s in a hotel or because it has views (probably a little of both), it ran to about 185Kč (~$9) a drink. That may not sound like much, but they were easily the priciest cocktails we&#8217;ve had in Prague and the previous holder of that title was around 145Kč (~$7).</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">For a hotel bar, Cloud 9 is pretty decent. You have good views of Prague and some tasty cocktails. The hassle of finding it plus the prices mean it&#8217;s not really worthwhile to go unless you&#8217;re staying at the Hilton.</span></p>

  <p>We moved to a (slightly) different area of Prague the other day. I was pretty excited because hey, there&#8217;ll be a whole new bunch of cocktail bars to go to! Looking online, it seemed like <a href="http://www.bugsysbar.cz/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Bugsy&#8217;s Bar</span></a> is one of the nicer cocktail bars in Prague. If you like <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague">Hemmingway</a>, Foursquare said, you&#8217;d like Bugsy&#8217;s. Their website is very slick – look how dapper the bartenders are, with their bow-ties and braces! Anyway, we gave it a shot. We weaved our way through old town street, went past a scary bouncer and down into a basement where the only lighting seemed to come from neon-pink spotlights pointed at the ceiling.</p>

  <div class="img">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Inside Bugsy&#8217;s</div>
  </div>

  <p>The crowd was&#8230; strange. Everyone was dressed as if they were in a club. Short skirts and heels for women, blazers and super-shiny shoes for the guys. When we walked out later that evening, we realised we must be in the &#8220;club&#8221; district, as every other doorway had a bouncer and a line of people waiting to get in. Maybe Bugsy&#8217;s is more of a pre-club venue?</p>

  <p>When we sat down, we were presented with one of the most amazing drink menus I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s a thick book designed as a graphic novel. The cocktails are split into broad categories, and each category has a beautiful double-page spread listing out the cocktails followed by a few pages of a story. We follow a single character through a noir scene (for classic cocktails), a Caribbean adventure (for rum cocktails), a scene with Batman (for &#8220;Gotham Cocktails,&#8221; whatever they are), and so on. There was even a page for mocktails where our hero ended up being pulled over and passing a breathalyser test.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the *range* of cocktails (despite the menu) was pretty disappointing. Nearly all were either classics, or vague variations on rum cocktails. I got a gin fizz and Hampton a vesper.</p>

  <p>For a bar snack, the server gave us this shot-glass of things that looked like undercooked chips. Turns out they were some kind of string-cheese that had been rolled in spices or something? It was super-weird.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Overall, I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. That plus my confusion (or their confusion) of what the bar <em>was</em>. The cocktails were pretty high-end, and not cheap – which suggests an upscale bar. Yet mix that with the disco soundtrack, weird pink lighting everywhere, and about-to-go-clubbing crowd and I didn&#8217;t really want to spend a lot of time there.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p><a href="http://www.blackangelsbar.cz/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Black Angel&#8217;s Bar</span></a> was recomended to us by a number of people – both bartenders and general cocktail-lovers. It&#8217;s in a basement just off the old town square, underneath a hotel. As we were taken down to the bar, we were warned about a long list of &#8220;no nos&#8221;: no cameras, no hats, no speaking too loud. It was a weird way to be introduced to a bar.</p>

  <p>The cocktails were inventive and presented well. They had a broad menu – a bunch of famous bartenders (I can&#8217;t vouch for their renown as I hadn&#8217;t heard of any of them. Saying that, I don&#8217;t know if I <em>could</em> name a famous bartender.) came up with a list of drinks. There&#8217;s a lot of award-winning cocktails in there too. I had a couple of pre-prohibition ones, which were delicious.

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Despite the cocktails being great, there was something a little off about the place. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the number of tourists (it is just off the main square, after all) or the man at the piano playing the theme song to Forrest Gump (?!), but it wasn&#8217;t as enjoyable of an experience as I thought it would be.</span></p>

  <p>Oh, and watch out for the bathrooms. They charge for their use for non-customers. I got confused and paid the person, but turns out that wasn&#8217;t necessary. (There was a sign saying &#8220;No charge for guests,&#8221; but I assumed they meant guests of the hotel.)</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/15/sansho-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>We asked for recommendations for the best retaurant in Prague and were told that <a href="http://www.sansho.cz/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Sansho</span></a> was the place to go. Most of the places I found online described it as Czech-Asian fusion, which sounded too weird to pass up. Plus, it was our <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/26/the-anniversary-question">third first-year anniversary</a> so we decided to book a table.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s in the north of the Old Town, on a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sansho/@50.091722,14.43483,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe3da7dc930221279">beautiful square</a> right next to this amazing church.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/sansho/church.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/sansho/church.jpg">
    </a> 
    <div class="alt">Church outside – notice the creepy bird installation on the tower</div>
  </div>

  <p>Apparently you can eat outside during the daytime, but it was a little chilly so we ate in. The interior was pretty sparse, and reminded me of <a href="http://www.suppenkuche.com/">Suppenküche</a> in San Francisco. There were long tables with benches for mixed group dining, as well as a couple of individual tables. The servers could have been from San Francisco, too. They were all in plaid shirts and may have just wandered in off Valencia Street.</p>

  <div class="img">

  </div>

  <p>For dinner, the only option you have is the set menu, which is fine by us. I love not having to decide what I&#8217;m going to eat. Each course came for the two of us to share. The set menu changes every night. What&#8217;s weird was that other tables didn&#8217;t get the same set menu that we did – some had the same dishes in a different order, some had a much different menu. It didn&#8217;t seem to be dictated by any dietary requirements, so I can&#8217;t quite figure it out. Anyway, onto the food.</p>

  <p>The first two courses were fish. There was a salmon sashimi, which was kinda standard. Then there was a soft-shell crab slider. It was really good. The bun had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_siu_bao">steamed bun</a> texture which went great with the crispy crab. There was a little too much wasabi on it for my taste, but whatever.</p>

    </a> 
    <div class="alt">Two: Soft-shell crab slider with wasabi cream (what&#8217;s up with the doily, amirite?)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Then there was a salad course: asparagus with ginger dressing and a crispy egg. I didn&#8217;t get the egg bit, but the asparagus with ginger was great. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had asparagus with more Asian-inspired flavours before. I guess this was the only thing that I could identify as really Czech-Asian fusion. Following the salad there were some gyoza, which were tasty but nothing special. (Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love gyoza, but they&#8217;re like crème brûlée to me: if you&#8217;re competent enough to make it, it&#8217;s gonna be delicious.)</p>

    </a> 
    <div class="alt">Four: Pork and shrimp gyoza </div>
  </div>

  <p>Next up were my favourite two dishes. First there was a tender pork belly with chunks of watermelon. The pork belly had a sticky, sweet sauce on the outside which melted perfectly with the watermelon. Then there was a panang-style curry with some chili jam. It was served with some bread, sticky rice and a papaya salad. The curry had a strange texture, and the server explained that it was made up of &#8220;everything else from the pig.&#8221;</p>

  <p>Apparently the restaurant is a &#8220;whole animal&#8221; restaurant. There was a chalk-board sign out front explaining this. Up until this point of the meal – aside from the whole crab slider – there wasn&#8217;t much evidence of the &#8220;whole animal&#8221; philosophy. But I guess getting a curry with &#8220;everything else&#8221; in it counts.</p>

    </a> 
    <div class="alt">Six: Pork panang with chili jam</div>
  </div>

  <p>Here&#8217;s another thing I&#8217;m a sucker for: dessert taster plates. I can never decide if I should get the sticky toffee pudding (it might be too heavy!) or the sorbet (it&#8217;s such a dull option!) or the apple pie (it might be too bland!). Every restaurant should have a dessert taster plate so I can eat all the desserts without feeling guilty.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/sansho/dessert.jpg">

    </a> 
    <div class="alt">Seven: Cookie with peanut ice-cream; cheesecake; sticky toffee pudding</div>
  </div>

  <p>The sticky toffee pudding was the favourite, but the cookie/peanut ice-cream came a close second.</p>

  <p>The seven courses and came out at about 1000Kč (~$50) per person, so pretty pricey for Prague. Plus they did this thing that I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of restaurants do here, which is give you something without you asking, then charge you for it. It&#8217;s happened with bread and jugs of water a bunch of times. I kind of assume that if something&#8217;s placed down on the table and I haven&#8217;t specifically asked for it, it&#8217;s going to be free. I don&#8217;t know if this is just a traditional thing or what, but I haven&#8217;t noticed it elsewhere in Europe really.</p>

  <p>All in all, <span itemprop="summary">Sansho is a great place for a special meal, with some inventive twists on Asian cuisine.</span> If you&#8217;re here for a special occasion and want something a little out of the ordinary, I&#8217;d recommend it. Just make sure you&#8217;re prepared for the bill.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Absinthe Tasting in Prague]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/11/absinthe-tasting-prague/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-11T13:38:26+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/11/absinthe-tasting-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>I&#8217;d read recently about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe">absinthe</a> was having a resurgence in popularity, especially in Prague. While we&#8217;re here, we decided to book a tasting with <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Absinthe Prague</span></a>.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;d had absinthe before in London, and I remembered enjoying it despite not liking anise-flavoured things. I was looking forward to tasting a range of absinthes to see if I could taste any differences.</p>

  <p>The tasting itself is in the basement of <a href="http://groovebar.cz/">Groove Bar</a>, a trendy cocktail bar <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Groove+Bar/@50.080446,14.416966,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b94f1c418d2a1:0xe8a4fa7d2309d51f">just off the river</a>. The host is Aaron Johns, an ex-pat living in Prague who definitely knows his stuff – both about absinthe and beer (he runs a <a href="http://tastelocalbeer.com/">local beer tour</a>, too). He gave a lot of interesting history on absinthe, most of which I had no clue about. He explained in detail all about how it&#8217;s made, why it&#8217;s made that way, and even about the ban. He was great at answering questions, too.</p>

  <p>The ritual of drinking absinthe was enjoyable to learn about and even more fun to do – the sugar cube, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo_effect">louche</a>, the absinthe spoon all came together to produce a great experience. You get a little absinthe in a glass, then balance the spoon over the top. Then you place a sugar cube on the spoon and drip ice-cold water onto the sugar until there&#8217;s a ratio of about five parts water to one part absinthe. As you drip the water in, the absinthe goes from clear to cloudy (the &#8220;louche&#8221;). At that point it&#8217;s ready to drink.</p>

  <p>The tasting covered six absinthes – two each from France, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. They all had unique characters and it was a lot of fun comparing notes with what others thought.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/absinthe.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/absinthe.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">The absinthes we tasted</div>
  </div>

  <p>We started out with a Swiss &#8220;le bleu&#8221; style – it was colourless rather than the vivid green usually associated with absinthe. During the louche it had a slight blue tint to it. The anise flavour was pretty strong, and that put me off a little.</p>

  <p>We then moved onto two &#8220;classic&#8221; absinthes – one French and one Swiss. They were both heavier on the wormwood, and less on the anise flavour. The French one, made by Pernod, was quite nice. The <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/absinthe-roquette-1797/">Roqeutte 1797</a> was apparently based on a recipe from the original inventor of absinthe. It had a really complex palate, having hints of citrus as well as the other anise/wormwood flavours. It was a little intense for me.</p>

  <p>My two favourites were the unconventional absinthes. Both produced in the Czech Republic, one was based on a honey liquor and one was from an American recipe. The honey one didn&#8217;t even need sugar added, and it went down really smoothly. It almost tasted like a cocktail. The American-recipe absinthe, <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/absinthe-butterfly/">Butterfly</a>, had almost a gin-like flavour. Perhaps I enjoyed it so much because it had flavours more like a liquor I was used to?</p>

  <p>The last absinthe was French: <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/la-grenouille-by-zufanek/">La Grenouille</a>. I was glad it was saved to the end, cause it had a very intense flavour.</p>

  <p>We ended up learning a lot about absinthe (such as what absinthe actually means, and the difference between absinthe and absinth) – it was a super-entertaining evening. The pours weren&#8217;t too heavy, so we weren&#8217;t blasted by the time we finished. It also gave both Hampton and me a deeper appreciation (and understanding) of the drink. In fact, the next night, we both ordered absinthe off the menu.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Absinthe Prague is great, and something you should definitely do if you&#8217;re seeking out a unique, informative evening with some tasty spirits.</span></p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/07/day-trip-to-kutna-hora/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-07T16:44:03+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/07/day-trip-to-kutna-hora</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prague has excellent rail connections to many smaller cities and towns in the Czech Republic. Taking day (or weekend) trips, especially if you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for an extended time, is pretty easy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a> was our first destination.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cd.cz/en/">website for the Czech rail system</a> is great – it gave detailed times and information on the trains, all in English. From Prague, there were direct trains to Kutná Hora every two hours or so. As our timing didn&rsquo;t line up, we took a train to Kolín, then transferred. Pro tip: jot down the final destination of your planned train. It won&rsquo;t be Kutná Hora! We ended up just following the other tourists. The journey took about an hour total, and ended up at Kutná Hora hl. n., the main train station in the town. (The journey back was a bit worse, but more on that later.)</p>

<p>Kutná Hora hl. n is close (about a 10 minute walk) to the Sedlec end of the town. In Sedlec (a small suburb of Kutná Hora) are two famous sites: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlec_Ossuary">Sedlec Ossuary</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Assumption_of_Our_Lady_and_Saint_John_the_Baptist">Church of the Assumption of Our Lady</a>. I&rsquo;d heard of the Ossuary before, and that was the main reason we were in the town.</p>

<p>Getting to the ossuary was pretty simple – there were some signs pointing in the right direction (follow those labelled &ldquo;Kostnice&rdquo;). When you get to the ossuary, you can buy a ticket for up to four attractions: the ossuary and the Church of Our Lady (both in Sedlec), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Barbara%27s_Church,_Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Church of St Barbara</a> and the Jesuit College (in the Kutná Hora town centre). The Jesuit College was closed on Mondays so we didn&rsquo;t go. The admission was 160Kč (~$8) for the three attractions.</p>

<p>The ossuary was neat. It was a lot smaller than I was expecting – basically one room, with a tonne of bones. It was creepy, but the number of tourists taking photos in there made it feel more like a room in the <a href="http://dedicatedtodlp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/potc-queue1.jpg">Pirates of the Caribbean queue</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Bones, skull and crossbones, bone chandelier, bone signature.</div>
</div>


<p>They hand out laminated sheets with some information on them, so you get a little historical information. However, I&rsquo;d recommend either loading up Wikipedia or having it on your phone for more detail.</p>

</div>


<p>After the ossuary, we went to the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. We were the only people in there. It was a little strange – I&rsquo;ve not really been in a Gothic-looking cathedral where all the walls are painted beige/yellow.</p>

</div>


<p>Aside from a couple of <a href="http://www.onestepinto.com/gallery/Kutna%20Hora/DSC_4303_Kutna_OSI.jpg">garishly-dressed relics</a> it was pretty dull. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend going but it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste as you walk right by it heading into town from the ossuary.</p>

<p>There are supposedly a number of buses that go from the ossuary into the centre, but we decided we&rsquo;d walk it. The best thing I can say about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sedlec+Ossuary,+Z%C3%A1meck%C3%A1,+284+03+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/St+Barbara's+Church,+Barborsk%C3%A1,+284+01+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/@49.9533462,15.2670308,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c40fc635ac54f:0x320cc9caa5f1508e!2m2!1d15.288043!2d49.961782!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c41a6cd710ae9:0xa19ced0f3eeca1db!2m2!1d15.26362!2d49.944911!3e2">the walk from Sedlec into Kutná Hora proper</a> is that it was about 40 minutes and got us a fair few steps on our fitbits. The walk is mainly through industrial and suburban parts of the town, and for the most part there&rsquo;s not much to look at. However, once you get into the centre itself, Kutná Hora is gorgeous.</p>

<p>There are a number of winding cobblestone back-streets with beautiful buildings. I think we could have spent a few hours just wandering around the town. We had a quick lunch at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274701-d1570760-Reviews-Restaurant_Cafe_Harmonia-Kutna_Hora_Central_Bohemian_Region_Bohemia.html">Café Harmonia</a>, which had amazing gnocchi. Then we headed for the next church on our list: St Barbara&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The walk up to the cathedral was beautiful – there&rsquo;s a promenade-type thing with statues along it that reminded us of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>From the promenade you get a great view looking over Kutná Hora.</p>

<p>Inside, St Barbara&rsquo;s was amazing. Much better than the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady.</p>

<p>There were murals all along the apse and the sides of the nave.</p>

<p>There were a few stained glass windows from the 1910s, which were neat. The one which I found interesting was from 2013. I find modern stained glass intriguiging as it&rsquo;s not really a standard modern art form (aside from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_%26_George">Gilbert and George</a>).</p>

<p>After we had explored the cathedral, we started our journey back to Prague. Rather than walk the 40 minutes back to Kutná Hora hl. n., we went to the station in the centre of town – Kutná Hora město. It&rsquo;s tiny and rural, without any real platforms. There&rsquo;s a shuttle train that runs between this station and the main station. When we arrived, the next train was in 40 minutes(!), and we didn&rsquo;t have much choice but to wait for it. We changed at the main station to a train to Kolín. From Kolín to Prague we ended up on the Berlin train, an EC-class train. It was slightly nicer than the R-class we took on the way there, but not by much. It ended up taking us about two hours for the return journey. I&rsquo;d recommend timing your trip back carefully.</p>

<p>All in all it was a pretty nice day trip. If you&rsquo;re travelling around the Czech Republic, or you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for a while and want to get out of the city, it&rsquo;s a fun thing to do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many people say how much they like Prague. I&rsquo;ve also heard many people say how much charm Prague has lost since the mid-90s, how it&rsquo;s now filled with tourists. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to expect. Would it be inviting and elegant, or a tourist-trap nightmare?</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve been here for three weeks, and I can safely say we both love the city. We love it so much we&rsquo;re planning on extending our time here until the end of July. It&rsquo;s got a mix of many things we enjoy about other European cities: the architectural beauty of Paris, the efficient transit of Berlin, the edginess (and cheapness) of Gdańsk. Plus, as I <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague">mentioned previously</a>, it has great cocktails.</p>

<p>The first seven days we were here, four nights had fireworks displays. There was a <a href="http://unitedislands.cz/">free music festival</a> the other weekend. There was <a href="http://www.prazskamuzejninoc.cz/">Prague Museum Night</a>, where museums stayed open until late at night. There&rsquo;s usually an open-air concert on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/St%C5%99eleck%C3%BD+ostrov/@50.08048,14.410501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x20fab08b45c47614">this island in the Vltava</a>. It seems like there&rsquo;s always something happening, and I think that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons we&rsquo;ve been drawn to Prague as a livable city.</p>

<p>Having said all of that&hellip; there are a tonne of tourists in certain areas – and this is where I maybe see why some people say Prague has lost its charm. We are (thankfully) staying about 10 minutes&#8217; walk from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square_(Prague)">Old Town Square</a>. We can easily get there if we want to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Orloj">Astronomical Clock</a> chime, but we&rsquo;re not trapped by the tourists.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s overwhelming, for sure. Cross into the Old Town and you pretty much hear only English being spoken. If you&rsquo;re thinking of staying in Prague, I&rsquo;d try and avoid that area if possible. The city is extremely walkable, so staying a little outside the centre shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. We&rsquo;re just south of Národní, which is perfect.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve jotted down some thoughts on the tourist-type stuff we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first thing we did, and the first thing I&rsquo;d suggest doing, is a self-guided walking tour. I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly impressed with the Rick Steves walking tours we&rsquo;ve done in previous cities, and his <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/eastern-europe">Prague city walk tour</a> was no different. The tour is available as a free podcast and takes about two or three hours. The recording itself is just over one hour, but we stopped in museums and cafés as we went.</p>

</div>


<p>The tour covers a lot of the history of not just Prague, but the Czech Republic as a whole. I was completely ignorant of the recent history of the country and found the descriptions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Palach">Jan Palach&rsquo;s suicide</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution">Velvet Revolution</a> quite stirring. You end up seeing all the main sights of Prague, which is great to orientate yourself. You can then go back and check out places that you find interesting on a different day (or stop along the way, as we did).</p>

<p>Another pretty common tourist thing to visit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_castle">Prague Castle</a>, which you can see from most places in Prague. We decided to foolishly climb up. I would not recommend it – it&rsquo;s a pretty steep climb. Take transit there instead!</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Those are the steps we had to climb up</div>
</div>


<p>The castle itself is apparently one of the largest castle complexes in the world. It&rsquo;s the seat of the President of the Czech Republic and has a bunch of government offices too. It&rsquo;s pretty cool, but&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it if you&rsquo;re only here for a couple of days.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ticket options – one has four of the major sights, the other has all ten of them. We went for the four-sight option, which was plenty. The audioguides were all out of battery (?!) when we went on a Monday, so that meant we didn&rsquo;t get quite as much information out of our visit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vitus_Cathedral">St Vitus&#8217; Cathedral</a> was the highlight by a long shot. It had some gorgeous art nouveau stained glass windows.</p>

<p>The other attractions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Basilica,_Prague">St George&rsquo;s Basilica</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Royal_Palace_(Prague)">Old Royal Palace</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lane">Golden Lane</a>) were&hellip; not as impressive. The Basilica had some interesting old murals, the Old Royal Palace had the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations_of_Prague">defenestration</a> window. Golden Lane was just a bunch of tourist shops, so I&rsquo;m not sure why it was included as an &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; in the ticket price.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn">Petřín Hill</a> is another imposing feature on the Prague skyline. We took the funicular to the top, which Hampton enjoyed because he loves funiculars. Apart from that, there wasn&rsquo;t much up there. Looking at the hill, it&rsquo;s covered in trees. We didn&rsquo;t quite realise that that meant there&rsquo;d be no view from the top of the hill. All you can see from up there is forest, pretty much. You could pay 100Kč or so (~$5) to go up a replica of the Eiffel Tower, which I&rsquo;m sure had better views, but we decided to spend our money instead on an old mirror maze.</p>

<p>The walk down is pleasant, so if it&rsquo;s a nice day I&rsquo;d recommend taking a trip.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all the tourist stuff we have done. Like I said, we&rsquo;ve mostly enjoyed the non-tourist stuff here. It&rsquo;s a great city to explore, especially with the number of parks for lazing and the random outdoor concerts we&rsquo;ve experienced. A great site we&rsquo;ve been using is <a href="http://www.expats.cz/">Expats.cz</a>, which has a list of events going on every day.</p>
