    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida">Jacksonville</a>, Hampton&rsquo;s hometown, is pretty sprawling. As such, it&rsquo;s difficult to get to different areas of the city without driving. Thankfully, Uber recently arrived so you can drink and get home safely (although with all the recent controversy, I don&rsquo;t know how comfortable you might be with using Uber).</p>

<p>The main areas of town we went to were Downtown, San Marco, and Avondale.</p>

<p>In Downtown, I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="http://www.dosgatosjax.com/">Dos Gatos</a>. The cocktails are great and reasonably-priced.</p>

<p>San Marco has <a href="http://www.grapeandgrainexchange.com/">Grape and Grain Exchange</a>, with the Parlour in the back. Grape and Grain Exchange is an up-scale package store. They have a great range of liquors there – and we got some to drink at home. However it&rsquo;s worth grabbing a drink at the bar, too. The atmosphere is a little bright – it is primarily a shop, after all – but the cocktails are good. In the back there&rsquo;s the Parlour, which is a speakeasy-style bar. The service is pretty slow but they have some decent seasonal cocktails.</p>

<p>Avondale&rsquo;s top spot for drinking is <a href="http://www.mojobbq.com/mojo-no-4-urban-bbq-whiskey-bar">Mojo Nº4</a>. They have an extensive range of whiskey cocktails, all of which were tasty. Their Vieux Carré was great.</p>

<p>If Mojos is packed (and it often is, so get there early), try the <a href="http://mellowmushroom.com/store/avondale-jax">Mellow Mushroom</a> just across the street. Their pizza is pretty good, too, if you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>

<p>All in all, there&rsquo;s a few good spots around town if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent cocktail. Just make sure you have a taxi number handy to get home!</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/12/02/the-journey-ends</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a plane. We&rsquo;re travelling back to San Francisco after seven months of being away from home. Here are some fun facts about our trip.</p>

<ul>
<li>226 days on the road</li>
<li>10 countries (with seven languages) visited</li>
<li>21 airports (SFO, IAD, DCA, ATL, JAX, PHL, CDG, VIE, AGP, LPL, STN, PRG, AMS, SXF, TXL, ARN, LHR, EWR, YTZ, JFK, DFW)</li>
<li>10 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage</a> sites (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_Czech_Republic">Historic Centre of Prague</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London">Tower of London</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster">Westminster</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam">Canals of Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Historic Centre of Vienna</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine">Banks of the Seine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Hall">Independence Hall</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello">Monticello</a>)</li>
<li>41 films watched (3 on a plane, 14 in the cinema, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes">1 with mostly Czech subtitles so I didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on</a>)</li>
<li>8 conferences attended</li>
<li>2 birthdays celebrated</li>
<li>1 Kindle lost</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking back, it&rsquo;s certainly been a lot of fun. But it&rsquo;s also been pretty stressful. At least, I remember it being stressful at the time. Already the rosiness of hindsight is taking over and I almost wish I was back travelling again.</p>

<p><em>Almost</em> wish. I&rsquo;m not leaving my couch for a while.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/29/the-disney-experience/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-29T06:31:49-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/29/the-disney-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For our five year anniversary, we decided to head down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Walt Disney World</a> for a few days. I had never stayed &ldquo;on property&rdquo; (i.e. in a Disney-branded hotel) before, so we opted to stay in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Port_Orleans_Resort">French Quarter New Orleans</a>. It&rsquo;s priced in the middle of the pack – not as expensive as the Grand Floridian or the Contemporary, but not as cheap as the All-Star resorts. (See a handy table on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World#On-site_Disney_resorts">Wikipedia page</a>.)</p>

<p>We also wanted to get our hands on the new Disney <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyMagic%2B#MagicBand">MagicBand</a>. It&rsquo;s an all-in-one ticket to the parks, key to your room, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Fastpass">FastPass</a>. We were really excited about getting them. You customise them online and they come in the mail.</p>

  <div class="alt">Magic Band box</div>

<p>The packaging reminded me of an Apple product – it was uncluttered and put the product up front.</p>

<p>The bands even had our names on the inside in case they got mixed up.</p>

<p>Staying on-site also gives you the opportunity to take the Disney buses from hotels to the parks. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about the hellish carpark at the end of the day. We decided to do the Disney dining plan, too – one snack, one quick meal, and one sit-down meal per day.</p>

<p>We checked into the hotel, and although the surroundings were nice, the room was disappointing. It was laid out exactly like a motel – a sink area you can see as you walk in the door, a curtain to separate it from the rest of the room. It seemed like that could be a useful layout for families, but it didn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;magical&rdquo; feeling I was expecting – especially for the price we were paying. I couldn&rsquo;t help but compare it to the far better Lowes Royal Pacific Resort at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Orlando">Universal</a>, where we stayed the previous week.</p>

<p>We were there for four days – with one day in each of the four WDW parks. On our first day, we headed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">Epcot</a> to catch the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot_International_Food_%26_Wine_Festival">Food and Wine Festival</a>. Held every autumn, they put up extra food stands around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot#World_Showcase">World Showcase</a> representing different countries/cultures.</p>

<p>Anyway, as Epcot is one of the parks where you can drink, we decided to take advantage of the Disney bus system. Here&rsquo;s a pro-tip: <strong>don&rsquo;t use the Disney bus system</strong>. Waiting at our hotel&rsquo;s bus stop, was awful. Three or four buses for the same park would go past, and no passengers would get on. When our bus did come by, it was packed. After about fifteen minutes&#8217; wait for the bus, it was another fifteen minutes to get to the park. Then you&rsquo;re dropped off quite far from the entrance, so there&rsquo;s some extra walking. It was <strong>not</strong> worth it. In the Disney vs. Universal battle, the walkable distance from the parks to the resort hotels makes Universal a much more convenient experience.</p>

<p>Our day at Epcot was a lot of fun, though. Spending a whole day at Epcot allowed us to wander through the World Showcase. We managed to walk through all the countries – into the back areas and shops, which tended to be empty. The amount of detail is incredible. It also helps that some of the countries (such as France and Germany) have wine. That kept us in a good mood.</p>

  <div class="alt">Wine at Epcot</div>
</div>


<p>We did Hollywood Studios the next day, then the Magic Kingdom. I was blown away by how busy the Magic Kingdom was – it was a Wednesday in the off-season and even high-throughput rides like Pirates of the Caribbean or the Haunted Mansion were at 50-minute queue times.</p>

<p>Animal Kingdom we left for the final day. They&rsquo;re apparently undergoing a lot of expansion, and we wanted to check it out before <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/01/construction-begins-for-avatar-inspired-land-at-disneys-animal-kingdom/">Avatar land opens</a>. We rode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_Everest">Expedition Everest</a> a couple of times – it&rsquo;s a great ride, but the only must-do at Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p>Two other disappointing things: the dining package and the FastPass options on the MagicBand. We got the standard dining package which, as I mentioned above, covers a snack, quick serve meal, and a sit-down meal. We booked it through Disney – as we were staying there three nights, we assumed the package would cover four days. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not the case – so be aware of that.</p>

<p>Also, the sit-down meal gives you two courses. However those two courses are <em>only</em> the entrée and dessert. You can&rsquo;t switch the dessert for an appetiser. That kinda sucked for us as neither of us really eat dessert.</p>

<p>We used two of our &ldquo;sit-down&rdquo; credits on <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/grand-floridian-resort-and-spa/citricos/">Citricos</a>, the fancy restaurant in the Grand Floridian. I&rsquo;ve got to say – the overall experience was a little strange. The food was top-notch, and you could see the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the main dining hall. But the drinks were terrible and there were mostly families there – so not particularly romantic or anything. Can&rsquo;t really complain about families, though, it being Disney and all that.</p>

<p>The best thing to do if you <em>do</em> get the deal is grab a Starbucks coffee at either the Magic Kingdom or Epcot. It counts as a snack – no matter how many extra espresso shots you get. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>FastPass is the way you skip lines at Disney. You used to get a card with a specific return time on it, but now you pre-arrange three rides you want to do at specific times. Staying on Disney property <em>does not</em> give you more than three. Everyone gets that. Compare with Universal, where if you stay on property you get an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Express_Pass">Express Pass</a> &ldquo;free,&rdquo; and it works any number of times for all designated rides.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be staying at a Disney resort any time soon. If we do, I think it would have to be one with better transit options (i.e. one on the monorail). Driving to the parks is a far better option than the bus. I just don&rsquo;t see any real benefit that staying on-property offers.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-18T07:03:17-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/18/halloween-horror-nights</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Horror_Nights">Halloween Horror Nights</a> (also known as &ldquo;HHN&rdquo;) is an annual even put on by the Universal Studios resort in Florida. On select evenings for some of September and most of October, the park is transformed into a halloween scare-park.</p>

<p>There are usually eight or so haunted houses built in soundstages. These will be themed around something, and you walk through decorated rooms while loud noises play and actors jump out at you. There are also scare zones – areas of the park usually just for walking between rides. In these, there will be a few props around a theme, plus some scare actors who move amongst the crowds.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Universal Studios&#8217; Entrance during Halloween Horror Nights</div>
</div>


<p>This year&rsquo;s event was a blast. We were worried that attending on 31st October (Halloween itself), <strong>and</strong> because it was a Friday this year, the queues would be incredibly long. We bought the express pass (an extra cost on top of the regular cost) but we were still unsure as to whether we&rsquo;d be stuck in two-hour-plus lines to see the houses. The express pass often only cuts the regular lines down by half.</p>

<p>So, we implemented a plan laid out in <a href="http://www.orlandoinformer.com/universal/halloween-horror-nights-2014/">Orlando Informer</a> – by far the best resource to look at if you&rsquo;re thinking of visiting HHN. The trick to HHN is that you can get early entry <em>if you have a ticket for Universal Studios that day</em>.</p>

<p>The park closes at 5pm on HHN nights. Around 4:45pm, the staff set up areas of the park where you can sit and wait until HHN begins. The official start time of HHN is 6:30pm. However you&rsquo;re often let out of the areas closer to 5:45pm. That&rsquo;s a good chunk of time to explore houses before people are let in.</p>

<p>The best area to wait is in New York at Finnegans, an Irish pub. It&rsquo;s packed in there, but we got some drinks and took them outside. We put our names in for a table (it was a 40-minute wait, but we thought we&rsquo;d chance it just in case). At about 5:15pm we sat down and ate a quick salad before leaving the &ldquo;pen&rdquo; and heading into the event.</p>

<p>The Orlando Informer article gives some great advice – head to the houses first, then do the scare zones. The lines for two of the most popular mazes – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">The Walking Dead</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator_(film)">Alien vs Predator</a> – were 20 minutes, which was great! We did those in quick succession.</p>

<p>The Walking Dead was touted as the largest house they&rsquo;d done – and it was filled with scare actors. Overall it was entertaining but unmemorable. There was one great scene in a forest, where I truly felt like zombies were coming at me from all sides. But apart from that, it seemed like a bunch of generic zombie scenes. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to season 4 enough?</p>

<p>Alien vs Predator did a great job of putting you in the <a href="http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Weyland-Yutani">Weyland-Yutani</a> corporation as the Aliens take over and Predators are brought in to control them. At least, that&rsquo;s what I think the gist of the house was – it wasn&rsquo;t incredibly clear. I&rsquo;m an Alien fan, so I mostly delighted in the incredible puppet animatronics they had. Plus the ending – crawling through a narrow air-duct with an Alien waiting at the end – was an exhilarating finish.</p>

<p>We headed over to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)">Halloween</a> house, which was over at the other end of the park. Here&rsquo;s another pro-tip: if the regular queue is pretty short, don&rsquo;t bother using your express pass. You can only use your express pass once per house. When we first went to the Halloween house, the queue was only 5 minutes – definitely not worth wasting our express on.</p>

</div>


<p>The house had every major scene from the 1978 classic. It was a lot of fun entering the (almost clichéd) house. The decor was perfectly 70s and I&rsquo;m glad we had a second pass at the house later on in the evening. There were a number of scenes we missed the first time around.</p>

<p>After these, we did the &ldquo;non-property&rdquo; houses. These are houses that aren&rsquo;t based on any existing intellectual property. This year, there were three: Giggles and Gore (about clowns), Roanoake (about cannibals), and Dollhouse of the Damned (about creepy dolls).</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Front of Dollhouse of the Damned</div>
</div>


<p>Once we&rsquo;d done those, we were free to wander around the scare zones and attend the shows (they have special halloween-only live shows during HHN). My favourite scare zone was based around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purge">The Purge</a>. Hampton and I both enjoyed the films, and the theme fits well with the New York area of Universal Studios.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Signature blue flowers</div>
</div>


<p>We noticed all of the above while touring the park during the day. At night, they bring out some extra props, like this sign.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Enjoy the Purge!</div>
</div>


<p>The other scare zone I enjoyed was based around the reality show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_Off_(TV_series)">Face Off</a>. Some of the most famous make-ups they&rsquo;ve had on the show were there.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/orlando/hhn24/face-off-1.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">FaceOff scarecrow thing</div>
</div>


<p>It was cool seeing them, but the scare zone just turned into a photo opportunity. We were guilty, too – we stood in front of the couple of make-ups we enjoyed from the series and took some photos. So not that scary, but fun nonetheless.</p>

<p>Halloween Horror Nights isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> scary. We&rsquo;ve found that smaller, local events are far scarier. Scare-actors at Universal Studios can&rsquo;t touch you. You move through the houses in a giant conga-line, rather than small groups.</p>

<p>With that said, Universal puts so much money into these houses that they&rsquo;re above and beyond anything you&rsquo;ll see at another horror event. The mazes are detailed and, for those based on films or TV shows, often amazingly accurate.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/13/universal-studios/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-13T11:47:30-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/13/universal-studios</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Orlando is a strange place. Knowing a number of people who live (and have lived) there, we&rsquo;re always instructed to explore the city. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much more than theme parks!&rdquo; we&rsquo;re told. And that&rsquo;s true! We explored a little last year – we were recording with Treehouse and found a couple of great places. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hansonsshoerepair">Hanson&rsquo;s Shoe Repair</a> is a cool speakeasy hidden behind a downtown bar/club. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Park,_Florida">Winter Park</a> area seems neat, too – we had a great meal at the <a href="http://www.theravenouspig.com/">Ravenous Pig</a>.</p>

<p>But exploring Orlando as a city wasn&rsquo;t on the agenda during this trip. We had four days booked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Orlando">Universal Orlando</a>, probably our favourite theme park complex.</p>

<p>In particular, we were there for two things: visiting the London/Diagon Alley extension of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizarding_World_of_Harry_Potter_(Universal_Orlando_Resort)">The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Horror_Nights">Halloween Horror Nights</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about Halloween Horror Nights in another post. Here I&rsquo;ll sum up the new Harry Potter area in Universal Studios. The London/Diagon Alley extension opened <a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201407/4112/">earlier this summer</a>. In all, they&rsquo;ve done a very good job. You start in London – it looks like a bunch of generic London buildings stuck together. The most exciting one (for me) was the King&rsquo;s Cross replica.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/orlando/kings-x.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">King&#8217;s Cross Station</div>
</div>


<p>I liked the fact that they used King&rsquo;s Cross (rather than the more gothic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station">St Pancras station</a> that was used in the films). It&rsquo;s a really good replica of the station (it was my London terminus when we lived in Cambridge). The departure board has legitimate trains – I&rsquo;ve been through Finsbury Park many times.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Departure board</div>
</div>


<p>You can walk into Platform 9 &frac34; and catch the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmede (in Islands of Adventure).</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Platform 9 3/4</div>
</div>


<p>The train ride is a lot of fun – the windows project your journey from London to Hogsmede. The train takes passengers back, with a different story, so make sure you ride it both ways. If you&rsquo;re short for time, we both preferred the London -> Hogsmede direction.</p>

<p>Diagon Alley itself is hidden behind an unassuming brick wall. So unassuming, we had to have it pointed out by a Universal employee. She saw our confused looks and whispered, &ldquo;You might want to check out that brick wall over there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It opens up into a narrow alleyway with an imposing dragon perched at the far end. It&rsquo;s sat on top of Gringotts and it makes for a stunning visual introduction to the area.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Diagon Alley</div>
</div>


<p>Make sure to check out the side alleys – there&rsquo;s one to each side as you walk in. In particular, Nocturn Alley (on the left as you walk in) is a dark and spooky area where you can buy all the skull-shaped items you could ever dream of.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the new ride: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Escape_from_Gringotts">Escape from Gringotts</a>. We had high hopes – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Forbidden_Journey">The Forbidden Journey</a>, over in Hogsmede, is one of our favourite rides.</p>

<p>The line times are pretty hefty – we were lucky enough to get in pretty early on a Thursday with only 30 minutes to wait. For the rest of the weekend, it was at least 120 minutes. The queue area is neat – you walk into Gringotts and see the main banking area.</p>

<p>You walk past these into the vaults and back rooms of Gringotts.</p>

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/orlando/gringotts-vaults.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Gringotts vaults</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s a weird break in the queue where you have your photo taken. I don&rsquo;t know why they do this – it&rsquo;s just against a plain background. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t want to put a camera on the ride? Not a clue. But there&rsquo;s more queuing after that.</p>

<p>Then you&rsquo;re put in a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; that takes you into the deepest vault area. You then walk <em>up</em> some stairs, grab some 3D goggles, and enter a mine-cart-like-thing. It looks a little like the one from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Mummy">Revenge of the Mummy</a>.</p>

<p>The ride is mostly large 3D projections following some half-arsed story about Voldemort. It is not an enjoyable ride. It fails in a couple of ways. To begin with, there&rsquo;s very little use of the track as a rollercoaster – there are maybe two small drops in total. It&rsquo;s definitely not an exciting ride, and makes me wonder why they decided to use a rollercoaster-style track without utilising any rollercoaster features.</p>

<p>Also, the ride is essentially a series of short 3D films. The great thing about The Forbidden Journey (or the older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Spider-Man">Spider-man ride</a>) was that they seamlessly blended real-life features (animatronics, props, forced perspective) with pre-done projected segments. The problem with Gringotts (and the recently-opened <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_The_Ride">Transformers: The Ride</a>) is that there&rsquo;s no inventiveness – you just move from one projection to the next, and that&rsquo;s the adventure.</p>

<p>Anyway, we were pretty disappointed. We wanted to ride it again to see if it improved on second ride, but with 120 minute queues we weren&rsquo;t willing to wait. The good news is that the rest of the area (and the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmede) was really fun – and that&rsquo;s enough reason to go.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/11/03/east-coast-road-trip-part-three</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Driving through Virginia is great – mostly because it reminds me of England. Gently rolling hills, lots of farms, big oak trees.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia">Charlottesville</a> was our first stop in Virginia. It&rsquo;s extremely beautiful and worth a visit – it&rsquo;s only a couple of hours to drive from Washington D.C. Just south of Charlottesville is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello">Monticello</a>, the residence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Compared with <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/28/east-coast-road-trip-part-two">the absurd cost to visit Biltmore</a>, Monticello is a steal – $25 per person. I&rsquo;d suggest booking in advance, especially on busy days. You can only go through the main part of the house as part of a guided tour – and those are every 15 minutes or so. It&rsquo;s nice to know when you need to show up.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/monticello-entrance.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/monticello-entrance.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Entrance to Monticello</div>
</div>


<p>The entrance to Monticello is at the bottom of a hill. It&rsquo;s got the usual visitor centre stuff – a gift shop, some small exhibits, a café, etc. All the stuff that you can&rsquo;t build next to the UNESCO-protected house.</p>

<p>You have two options for getting to the house itself – a five-minute bus ride or a fifteen-minute walk. We arrived about half an hour before our allotted tour and walked up. It&rsquo;s a great walk (although mostly uphill) and I&rsquo;d recommend doing it if you have the time/physical capability.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Walk up to Monticello</div>
</div>


<p>On the way up, you pass by the graveyard where Thomas Jefferson is buried.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/jefferson-grave.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Jefferson&#8217;s Grave</div>
</div>


<p>The grounds are expansive and the architecture of the complex is unique. There are a couple of terraces stretching along both sides of the house with servant quarters underneath. It&rsquo;s fun to wander around the outside a little. But be careful with your timing: the tours start far before their posted time. We arrived ten minutes before ours was due to start, and the group was already together and being told about the surrounding gardens.</p>

<p>The tour was equally interesting and overwhelming for me. I didn&rsquo;t know much about Thomas Jefferson – my British education wasn&rsquo;t focussed on American history. There were a lot of &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; facts that, for me, weren&rsquo;t so obvious. &ldquo;You all know that Jefferson and Adams had a fraught relationship,&rdquo; &ldquo;naturally you all know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings">Sally Hemings</a>.&rdquo; I had to nudge Hampton and ask him to fill in missing details. So if you&rsquo;re not American (or didn&rsquo;t pay attention in history), I&rsquo;d recommend reading up a little on his life before you come.</p>

<p>The house had some interesting areas. The entrance hall was used by Jefferson as a museum of sorts to prove to visitors that the Americas were ecologically and culturally distinct from the rest of Europe. Jefferson&rsquo;s bed was in an alcove that split his bedroom from his office. You can&rsquo;t take pictures inside, so I don&rsquo;t have any images of this stuff. But I do have a goofy photo of us standing outside the back of the house.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really picturesque on the grounds, and it&rsquo;s easy to take gorgeous photos.</p>

</div>


<p>Afterwards, we drove through Charlottesville and briefly saw the Jefferson-designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia">University of Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>That night we stayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton,_Virginia">Staunton</a>. It&rsquo;s a small town with a quiet centre and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_Presidential_Library">Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library</a>. We grabbed a Priceline deal at the <a href="http://www.stonewalljacksonhotel.com/">Stonewall Jackson Hotel</a>, which despite its questionable name, was fairly decent.</p>

<p>We found a well-reviewed cocktail bar and restaurant called <a href="http://zynodoa.com/">Zynodoa</a>. It was packed at 7:30pm on a Tuesday. Its decor and cocktails wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place in New York. The same went for its prices – the cheapest entrée was $25. So we decided to go somewhere that seemed a little lower-rent: a BBQ place called <a href="http://www.millstreetgrill.com/">Mill Street Grill</a> – it had great reviews so we were pretty excited.</p>

<p>I wish we&rsquo;d have stuck with Zynodoa. The entrées at Mill Street Grill were about the same price (~$25), and the menu reminded me of something out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a>. You know how Gordon Ramsay always complains when a menu is too large or haphazard? This menu was exactly that. There was Italian food, steaks, salads, BBQ, seafood, sandwiches. Hampton couldn&rsquo;t decide what he wanted, so he asked our waitress to pick from one of three. She didn&rsquo;t ask something like &ldquo;Do you like pasta?&rdquo; – she said &ldquo;How hungry are you?&rdquo; A bad sign.</p>

<p>We got our entrées and they were fairly tasty, but definitely not worth the price tag (why is some small town in Virginia charging so much?). The decor was bizarre – they had a bunch of deflated star and moon balloons hanging from the ceiling, a stained-glass window and a bust of Elvis (!?) on the bar. I&rsquo;d avoid it if you&rsquo;re ever in Staunton.</p>

<p>The next day we drove to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Virginia">Lexington, VA</a> – an even tinier town whose main attraction is the two universities. We were there to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University">Washington &amp; Lee</a>, where Hampton&rsquo;s father and brother both studied.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/washington-and-lee.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/washington-and-lee.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Washington & Lee</div>
</div>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chapel">Lee Chapel</a> is opposite the main buildings of the university, and we were lucky enough to catch a historian giving a short tour of the chapel explaining its history.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Lee Chapel</div>
</div>


<p>Inside it&rsquo;s all white. There are two portraits above the stage – one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a> and one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>. I found the Washington one amusing as he&rsquo;s in his British Army uniform. It&rsquo;s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Willson_Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a>, and I had to get a photo of it.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">George Washington in his British Army getup</div>
</div>


<p>In the back of the chapel is a statue of Lee. It&rsquo;s not a tomb – he&rsquo;s actually buried underneath the chapel in a crypt.</p>

<p>They also have a reconstruction of his office under the chapel. Right outside is buried Lee&rsquo;s beloved horse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(horse)">Traveller</a></p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/traveller.jpg">

</div>


<p>Visiting Washington &amp; Lee was a nice detour on our trip. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it from Hampton&rsquo;s father, and it was nice to see that.</p>

<p>A brief aside: I&rsquo;m still not comfortable with the promotion – if not glorification – of Confederate generals that occurs in the South. I&rsquo;ve heard various justifications on numerous occasions. I understand that Lee <em>himself</em> didn&rsquo;t agree with slavery, but had to go with what his home state of Virginia wanted. However it still feels wrong. And it&rsquo;s still jarring when I see names like Stonewall Jackson or Robert E. Lee on schools or highways.</p>

<p>We made a brief family-history stop on the way there. I&rsquo;ll probably write a longer blog post about this in the future, as it might be handy for some Marshall descendants to know about. In short, we visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Creek,_Virginia">Happy Creek</a>. One of Hampton&rsquo;s family lineages is the Marshall family. They owned a property in Virginia called Happy Creek which, around 1912, burned down. Here&rsquo;s the ruins:</p>

<p>Nearby, there&rsquo;s the Marshall family graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Markham_Marshall">James Markham Marshall</a> is the brother of the Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall">John Marshall</a> and also Hampton&rsquo;s great-(x4)-grandfather.</p>

<p>After visiting, we went to Washington D.C. to see our niece. Then we had a long drive back to Jacksonville – with one short stopover in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia">Savannah</a> because&hellip; well, why not? Savannah is beautiful. Now we&rsquo;re back in Jacksonville for a few days before heading to Orlando for a conference and (<em>cue spooky music</em>) <a href="http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com/orlando/">Halloween Horror Nights</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/28/east-coast-road-trip-part-two</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the southern outskirts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina">Asheville</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate">Biltmore Estate</a>. Built by the Vanderbilt family in the 1890s, it&rsquo;s the largest home in the U.S.A. and is open for tours. It&rsquo;s ridiculously expensive to visit – $60 per person is the cheapest adult ticket. Once you get in, there isn&rsquo;t much guidance on where to go, so the audio guide is well worth the extra $10. If you&rsquo;re spending $60 already&hellip; might as well, right?</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/biltmore.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/biltmore.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Front of Biltmore</div>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been to a fair share of grand homes in the UK and France, and it was interesting to see the American version of that. Obviously, this house was built way after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace">Blenheim</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles">Versailles</a>. It had a lot more modern aspects that surprised me. For example, electricity was used widely throughout the house – the clocks were synchronised that way. The indoor swimming pool (!) was lit with DC bulbs. There was an electric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbwaiter_(elevator)">dumbwaiter</a> from the kitchens. All of these &ldquo;modern&rdquo; marvels I&rsquo;d never seen in a grand home before.</p>

<p>Also, it was very noticeably a <em>home</em>, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily clear in other stately homes. Wandering around Versailles, how easy is it to imagine people living their lives there? Pretty tricky, in my opinion. Biltmore felt planned as a home – areas for family friends, areas for casual everyday living. It was far more welcoming in that regard. I&rsquo;m still not sure if it&rsquo;s worth the price tag, but I guess I&rsquo;m glad I saw it.</p>

<p>Asheville itself seemed nice, although we didn&rsquo;t stay in the centre. The only place we managed to get to was <a href="http://theadmiralnc.com/">The Admiral</a>, in the west side of the city. It was recommended by a number of people. Booking reservations was tricky – on a Monday night the only two slots were 5:30pm and 9pm. It&rsquo;s a popular place!</p>

<p>From the outside, it doesn&rsquo;t look like much.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The Admiral</div>
</div>


<p>It seems more like a dive bar than anything. Inside, it&rsquo;s even decorated like a bit of a dive bar. No tablecloths, neon beer signs on the wall. The menu is pretty high-falutin, though. Tasty cocktails to begin with.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-cocktails.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-cocktails.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Cocktails</div>
</div>


<p>Then some fancy versions of mostly Southern food. We ended up getting a bunch of small plates and one large plate – the pork chop – as we&rsquo;d heard so much about it. By far the stand-out dish was the mussels.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-mussels.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-mussels.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mussels</div>
</div>


<p>They&rsquo;d been cooked in a PBR/tomato/chipotle broth and it was delicious. We also got the fried gnocchi, which tasted just like tater tots. The steak tartare was nice but came with a bunch of sriracha over the plate (whyyyyyy???). We got some fried sweetbreads with chipotle grits. They were good, but didn&rsquo;t really take advantage of the sweetbread itself – it could have been any random chunk of meat. The creaminess of the sweetbreads, if anything, just melded into the creamy grits. The pork chop was tough but tasty. It came with some way-too-sweet mac and cheese.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the meal we sat outside on the porch – right next to a gas fire. It was a pleasant end to the meal.</p>

<p>The next day, we headed to Raleigh for <a href="http://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a>. It&rsquo;s a gigantic conference – I think there were about 1,000 attendees and ten tracks. I didn&rsquo;t manage to go to half the talks I wanted to, but I did have a good time hanging out. I finally got to meet the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/trek">Trek</a>, who&rsquo;s hung out with Hampton at a bunch of conferences.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a decent cocktail in Raleigh, head to <a href="http://www.common414.com/">Common 414</a>. They had a solid selection of classic cocktails and didn&rsquo;t seem to get too busy (at least when we went, which admittedly tends to be earlier in the evening).</p>

<p>Due to a scheduling mix-up, we had to leave Raleigh earlier than anticipated. Our next couple of stops were in the heart of Virginia – and I&rsquo;ll be talking about those in the next post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After leaving New York, we flew down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida">Jacksonville</a>, Florida. We borrowed a car from Hampton&rsquo;s grandfather and started the next portion of our journey: the East Cost road trip. Hampton had been invited to conferences in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina">Raleigh</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida">Orlando</a>, plus we have family in North Carolina and DC, so we decided to drive around a little and I&rsquo;d get to see a few more of the off-the-beaten-track parts of the South.</p>

<p>Our first leg was from Jacksonville to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina">Greenville</a>, South Carolina. Hampton went to college at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_University">Furman</a> – just north of the town.</p>

<p>The drive up was lonnng – it took us about eight hours (including stops and some hellish traffic around Columbia). We passed through Georgia:</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Is the 1996 Olympics the only thing Georgia is proud of?</div>
</div>


<p>And into South Carolina:</p>

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/sc-gates.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">South Carolina had some pretty sweet gates</div>
</div>


<p>After driving west across most of South Carolina, we stayed in Greenville for one night. It was a neat town, with a fair few restaurants and it was pretty lively at night. There was a young kid busking – doing magic tricks with his Dad, which was super-adorable.</p>

<p>We went to Furman the next morning. It&rsquo;s a self-contained campus and is quite beautiful. There&rsquo;s a lake surrounded by trees and a bell tower on one end.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/furman.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The bell tower</div>
</div>


<p>It was weird being at Hampton&rsquo;s old university. I think it was a strange trip for him, as he started recalling tales of parties or particular professors. What was also cool to see was the football pitch where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a> got his start.</p>

<p>After that, we continued into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantahala_National_Forest">Nantahala National Forest</a>. There were a ton of beautiful lookout spots and hiking bits on the way there. Here&rsquo;s a few:</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Table Rock, an outcrop</div>
</div>


<p>Table rock was a little unnerving. It&rsquo;s basically a large, gently-sloping rock overlooking the forest. Every time you think you&rsquo;re at the edge, you can walk a little bit further down. It was strange seeing people further down the rock and thinking, &ldquo;Wow, they&rsquo;re in a dangerous spot!&rdquo;&hellip; and then passing them.</p>

<p>Of course, driving around the South you see some interesting decorations.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ahh, the South</div>
</div>


<p>We drove further up into the mountains and stayed at the <a href="http://www.highlandsinnlodge.com/highlandsInnLodgeIntro.html">Highlands Inn Lodge</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlands,_North_Carolina">Highlands</a>, North Carolina. It was a nice place, although a little out of the centre (but I&rsquo;m sure you could walk if necessary).</p>

<p>The leaves were amazing – every road was a bordered with greens, yellows, oranges, reds and browns.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Autumnnnnn</div>
</div>


<p>After spending a couple of nights in Highlands, we drove along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> through the forest. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous road – you&rsquo;re basically on the ridge of the mountain range and have epic views from both sides.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s stopping points every few hundred yards because there&rsquo;s that many photogenic scenes.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/14/worlds-best-bars-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-14T14:18:22-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/14/worlds-best-bars-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/4841/Artesian_named_The_World_92s_50_Best_Bars_champion_2014.html">Drinks International&rsquo;s list of the top 50 cocktail bars</a> in the world. Sure, it&rsquo;s probably a list you can pay to appear on or whatever, but I love lists.</p>

<p>Turns out on our European trip we managed to hit six of them! So I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about my cocktail game.</p>

<ul>
<li>3 - <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar/">Nightjar</a>, London</li>
<li>12 - <a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/">Happiness Forgets</a>, London</li>
<li>17 - <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/24/cocktails-in-paris/">Candelaria</a>, Paris</li>
<li>24 - <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/">Hemingway Bar</a>, Prague</li>
<li>26 - <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/09/amsterdam-food/">Door 74</a>, Amsterdam</li>
<li>49 - <a href="http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/welcome/">Callooh Callay</a>, London</li>
</ul>


<p>The only other one I&rsquo;d been to was #16, <a href="http://smugglerscovesf.com/trapdoor/">Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove</a>, in San Francisco. I still haven&rsquo;t been to #33, <a href="http://www.trickdogbar.com/">Trick Dog</a> – although it&rsquo;s been on my to-do list for a while. I&rsquo;ll probably head there as soon as I get back to SF.</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve only got two more nights in New York, I&rsquo;m not too sure we&rsquo;ll be able to hit the NYC ones on the list. But it&rsquo;s good to know they&rsquo;re out there.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2014-10-16)</strong>: Last night we went to number 5 on the list: <a href="http://www.employeesonlynyc.com/">Employees Only</a>, in New York&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Village">West Village</a>. It&rsquo;s a cool exterior – only a neon sign saying &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; indicates the location. There&rsquo;s a tiny room you go through that has a psychic doing tarot readings (if you should feel so inclined).</p>

<p>Inside it was packed. It&rsquo;s not a large space and most of the back is taken up with dining tables. The bar was two people deep (since when was Wednesday so packed?) and we were constantly being bustled by the waitstaff walking with food to tables nearer the front. There was no chance of getting a seat.</p>

<p>The drinks were OK – I got a Provençal and Hampton got the Billionaire Cocktail. Hampton&rsquo;s was way better; mine was a little bland, to be honest. Some subtle lavender flavour but that was about it. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy it there – and definitely don&rsquo;t think it deserves the number five spot.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/employees-only.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/employees-only.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Provençal (in front) and a Billionaire Cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s mainly due to atmosphere. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that if you&rsquo;re a fancy cocktail bar, seating-only is the way to go. Maybe that means you have to take reservations, but the overall experience is far better. For example, I had a much better time at <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk&amp;Honey</a>, where you sat down and the waitstaff helped you choose a drink.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the same reason I didn&rsquo;t enjoy Candelaria, in Paris, which is number 17 on the list. It was way too crowded and felt more like a sports bar during a Super Bowl than a nice cocktail place.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: (2014-11-05)</strong>: Milk &amp; Honey closed on the 25th October, according to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/milk-and-honey-new-york-3">the most recent Yelp review</a>.</p>

    <updated>2014-10-10T08:33:48-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/10/sass-conf-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week was the second <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a>. After having a blast last year, we had to come back (and it gave us a great excuse to be in New York City for a while).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/itsmisscs">Claudina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Snugug">Sam</a>, and the other organisers did a great job of having community events for the whole week in the run-up to the conference. A large number of SassConf attendees were staying in New York for a while, so it was a great idea to have some &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; community events beforehand.</p>

<p>There were great talks by <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith Schwartz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickhamann">Patrick Hamann</a> on Monday night. On Wednesday there was a fireside chat with the Sass Design team. Hampton talked about the original concept behind Sass and its unconventional branding, then <a href="https://twitter.com/jina">Jina Bolton</a> walked through the complete redesign of the <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass website</a> that she spearheaded last year.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Wednesday&#8217;s Sass Design fireside chat</div>
</div>


<p>It was a fitting topic – at last year&rsquo;s SassConf, the new website was launched. <a href="https://twitter.com/bermonpainter">Bermon Painter</a> joined in to explain the new logo, too. It was an entertaining evening.</p>

<p>The first day of the conference consisted of talks. It was neat hearing from <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una</a> about the global Sass community, and I always enjoy listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith</a> talk about art and how you can bring art into your everyday life.</p>

<p>It was also great to finally give <a href="https://twitter.com/nex3">Natalie</a> the <a href="https://thenetawards.com/">net Game-Changer of the Year award</a>. It was picked up by <a href="https://twitter.com/kaelig">Kaelig</a> back in May. He gave it to us when we were in London, then we asked my Mum to ship it to New York for SassConf.</p>

<p>The next day was workshop-based. I wasn&rsquo;t able to go to any, but from what I could see on Twitter people had a great time and learnt a lot.</p>

<p>The after-party was on Friday night, and it involved a boat trip (with open bar and karaoke) around the bottom of Manhattan. I guess boats are &ldquo;in&rdquo; at conferences – we did a boat trip for lunch during <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">LaConf</a> in Paris.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was <em>awesome</em>. Seeing any city from a new perspective is great, and Manhattan is absolutely gorgeous at night.</p>

</div>


<p>We sailed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Piers">Chelsea Piers</a> to near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. Then, on the way back, we got really close to the Statue of Liberty!</p>

  </a>

</div>


<p>The number of attendees at the conference was small enough that you recognised most people at the after-party. I felt like I could go up to anyone and strike up a conversation. Everyone had a great time.</p>

<p>The next day was the &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; – something I&rsquo;m not familiar with at all. The idea is that people would form their own groups to talk/discuss/code about what they&rsquo;re feeling passionate about. I must admit, I was pretty sceptical going into the day. I expected it to end up being isolated people working on their own thing, with minimal discussions.</p>

<p>I was very wrong.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The unconference was held in the New Work City offices</div>
</div>


<p>Within the first ten minutes, all the meeting rooms had been booked up with various meetings – everything from the minutiae of libsass to contributing to open source to motivation for making things. It was great seeing strangers come together to discuss these topics and try to figure out solutions or help each other out.</p>

<p>I recruited Smith and a couple of other people to help me with a project I&rsquo;ve been sitting on for a while. It&rsquo;s almost done and I&rsquo;ll be posting about it soon.</p>

<p>It was a great end to the conference, and really drove home one of the things that I believe sets the Sass community apart from most other tech communities I&rsquo;ve seen: the realisation that building a diverse and welcoming community is just as important as building the technology itself.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-30T08:36:49-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post has an awkward title. That&rsquo;s chiefly because the bars in New York are so numerous that I couldn&rsquo;t claim knowledge of even 0.1 percent. I couldn&rsquo;t even claim to have exhausted bars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a> (our current neighbourhood), or even the Ninth Avenue bit of Chelsea. In fact, a more accurate title for this post would be &ldquo;Bars Between 20th and 17th Streets on Ninth Avenue: A Small Sampling.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange coming from Prague, where we managed to check off almost all of the decent cocktail bars in the centre, to a city where we&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been trying out some of the recommended bars in the area. We haven&rsquo;t found a bar we&rsquo;re completely comfortable with – the nice mix of decent cocktails and relaxed atmosphere has eluded us so far in Chelsea.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tipsyparson.com/">Tipsy Parson</a> is a great restaurant as well as a pretty good cocktail bar. You know how often, a Southern-style restaurant can&rsquo;t beat the food you actually get in the South? Well, that&rsquo;s not the case here. I had fried catfish with gravy, and Hampton had shrimp and grits. Both were great – the catfish was crisp and the gravy wasn&rsquo;t too peppery (which happens a lot with Southern gravy).</p>

<p>Looking at the menu, we spotted the head chef&rsquo;s name: Ty-Lör Boring. That&rsquo;s quite an unusual na- wait, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/people/ty-lor-boring/bio"><em>that</em> Ty-Lör</a>, from Top Chef?! It was!</p>

<p>They also have seats at the bar. The cocktails are a little bit hit and miss. They&rsquo;re trying hard to be inventive, but a lot of them miss the mark. There was a ginger-based drink that was <em>way</em> too gingery, even for me. The Professor Plum was pretty good, although due to seasonal changes of the menu I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s available any more.</p>

<p><a href="http://bathtubginnyc.com/">Bathtub Gin</a> is a speakeasy behind a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s quite conspicuous for a speakeasy – walking past on a Saturday night you see a line of people outside an empty coffee bar. I&rsquo;m no fool! No coffee is that tasty. We booked for 6pm on a quiet night and even then the bouncer made us wait outside, despite it being empty when we were eventually let in.</p>

<p>The drinks were quite good. We started out with a Martini and a Blushing Lady #2.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Blushing Lady #2</div>

<p>The Blushing Lady #2 tasted like a sour grape candy. The Martini was OK. The secound round proved better – a Vesper and a Last Word.</p>

<p>They had some great small plates to share – the mushroom gnocchi was my favourite. The pork belly sliders were also super-tasty.</p>

</div>


<p>The staff were a little stand-offish, which I&rsquo;m getting tired of when it comes to fancy speakeasy-style bars. Bourbon &amp; Branch in SF has a similar problem. (<em>Update</em>: we went to the speakeasy <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk and Honey</a> and the staff there were delightful. The drinks were great too!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php">La Bottega</a> is in a crazy-looking hotel called the Maritime. Its windows are all circular, and it&rsquo;s sides are sloped inwards. The drinks there are OK, but not very well balanced. The Vesper tasted like pure vodka; the Manhattan was almost pure vermouth.</p>

<p>Some other bars we&rsquo;ve been to in the Chelsea area (but not on 9th) are <a href="http://www.theparknyc.com/">The Park</a>, on 10th avenue, and <a href="http://heartwoodnyc.com/">Heartwood</a>, on 8th.</p>

<p>The Park is in a beautiful converted parking garage, with an indoor &ldquo;garden&rdquo; area. The front bar was pretty crowded, so we sat in the garden area where – pro-tip – there&rsquo;s a secret back bar! We ordered drinks from both and the back bartender was way better. Plus there was no wait at the back bar.</p>

  <div class="alt">Hendrick&#8217;s Mash</div>
</div>


<p>Heartwood is on 8th Avenue, between 20th and 19th. I ordered a couple of drinks there and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy them – one was my fault, the other the bartender&rsquo;s. The menu had sections, one of which was classifed as &ldquo;Shrubs.&rdquo; Not being familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_(drink)">drink called a shrub</a>, I picked one with gin in it. Turns out, they really do put vinegar in them. It was surprising on first taste, then just became kinda throat-burning. I love vinegar, but drinking it is a little difficult. Anyway, I put that mistake down to me, and not the bar itself. However, I then ordered a Last Word and they missed out the lime. That makes it a little undrinkable – just sweet and herbal. My first drink was too acidic, my next not acidic enough. There&rsquo;s no pleasing me.</p>

<p>Anyway, SassConf has started and I&rsquo;ll no doubt be writing about that as the week goes on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re in New York City! The Big Apple! The city that never sleeps! Etc. etc.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d booked a small but nicely-designed AirBnB in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a>. After a small mix-up with the address (turns out the listed address was one street off, for some reason), we arrived and settled in. It was a little dirty, and there were no towels, but a quick stop at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bed+Bath+%26+Beyond/@40.7406703,-73.9942279,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x89c25d0c60996adb:0x480c0d194112b5d3!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sbed+bath+and+beyond+nyc!3m1!1s0x0:0x231ff6a484b76185">Bed, Bath and Beyond</a> sorted our need for cleaning supplies and linen.</p>

<p>Our first morning, we woke up and ran some quick errands. When we came back, the power was off at the apartment. We texted the host, who said that she was at work and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sort anything out until after 4pm – in about 6 hours (!). So&hellip; we wandered over to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art">Whitney</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons">Jeff Koons</a> retrospective. I love the Whitney – give me their brutalist architecture over the Guggenheim any day. They&rsquo;re moving to a new building next year so I&rsquo;m glad I got to visit their current space one last time.</p>

<p>The Koons retrospective was great. I was only familiar with a few of his works, and the exhibition did a great job of fleshing out the rest. The Equillibrium stuff was mesmerising. Definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re around (it&rsquo;s on until the 19th October, I think) – and grab the free audioguide too!</p>

<p>Still having a few hours to kill, we went to see a film. There&rsquo;s not a whole lot on right now (I&rsquo;m waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Girl_(film)">Gone Girl</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)">Inherent Vice</a> this autumn), so we took a chance on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drop_(film)">The Drop</a> with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and James Gandolfini. It&rsquo;s a slow-burning crime character study, although it&rsquo;s quite difficult to categorise. Tom Hardy does a great job of making a meek, loveable – but potentially dangerous – guy. It was also nice (but sad) to see James Gandolfini in what is his last feature-film role.</p>

<p>The film finished and we headed back to the apartment – the electricity was still off. We tried contacting our host, who told us that she&rsquo;d forgotten to pay the electricity bill for the past couple of months. Not only that, but everyone had gone home for the day and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to turn the power on until tomorrow. Oh dear.</p>

<p>By this point, it was starting to get dark and our living area looked a little bit like this:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The sofa</div>
</div>


<p>We called AirBnB who, to their credit, had great customer support. They said they&rsquo;d comp us for a meal and a hotel for that night. They said if the power wasn&rsquo;t on tomorrow, they&rsquo;d help us find a new place in NYC.</p>

<p>They arranged everything and got us a room at a <a href="https://www.kimptonhotels.com/stay/eventi-hotel-chelsea-ny">nearby Kimpton</a>. So, we packed up our satchels for an overnight adventure. We stopped for a quick meal on the way, and arrived at about 10:30pm. The check-in desk told us they were all booked up, and only had one strange room left – a library with a veranda. They said we could look at the room first, but we decided to go with it. At this point, as long as we had power we didn&rsquo;t really mind.</p>

<p>We got to the room and it was more of a suite or event space. One half had a library.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Library</div>
</div>


<p>And the other half had a dining room.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Panorama of the library</div>
</div>


<p>The room was on the corner of the building and had a wrap-around balcony/veranda. From there you had a great view of the Empire State Building.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The view from the veranda</div>
</div>


<p>We were feeling pretty great about this room until&hellip; wait, where was the bed?</p>

<p>Turns out, they forgot to bring a bed into the room. We called down to the front desk and they promptly sent up a couple of guys to make up a sofa bed for us.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Our bed</div>
</div>


<p>It was pretty comfortable, for a sofa-bed. Anyway, to make up for the weird room and lack of a proper bed, they gave us some credit for room service. As we&rsquo;d already eaten, we used the credit on better things.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Better things = wine</div>
</div>


<p>The next morning we headed back to the apartment and the power was still off – however the host had arranged for the electricity company and the super to come and get it all sorted out.</p>

<p>Although it was a bit of a nightmare, this is the first bad experience with AirBnB we&rsquo;ve had in the five months we&rsquo;ve been travelling. The AirBnB customer support was great, and the host also said she&rsquo;d give us the previous night free. Still, it was a pretty stressful adventure.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-20T09:10:44-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/20/bar-chef</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>We&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.worldsbestbars.com/">World&#8217;s Best Bars</a> to find bars when we&#8217;ve been travelling. It&#8217;s a little hit-and-miss, and you need to do some extra research before you randomly pick one. But it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re in a place that doesn&#8217;t really use Yelp or FourSquare. We showed it to Mike and Melissa, and they laughed at a lot of the choices for Toronto. One, however, they recommended: <a href="http://www.barcheftoronto.com/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Bar Chef</span></a>.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s in the second-coolest neighbourhood in the world (according to <a href="http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/1080625/fifteen-coolest-street-style-neighborhoods/">Vogue</a>) – Queen Street West. They serve fancy cocktails and want to &#8220;challenge the [&#8230;] cocktail experience.&#8221; SOUNDS FUN!</p>

  <p>Oh, it was dark inside, so most of my photos are a little grainy. Sorry.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/barchef.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Bar Chef placemat</div>
  </div>

  <p>We started out with two normal-ish cocktails. The Symphony No 5 was a gin/vanilla thing that was OK. The Basil Daiquiri was tasty – super-drinkable.

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/symphony-daiquiri.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Symphony No. 5 and the Basil Daiquiri</div>
  </div>

  <p>These two cocktails were pretty good. However, we noticed there was a &#8220;modernist&#8221; section that had more expensive ones – some with some weird ingredients (&#8220;spring fog&#8221;? &#8220;beach essence&#8221;?).</p>

  <p>Hampton got a $45 (!) Manhattan. It came under a giant cloche filled with smoke.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan-cloche.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan-cloche.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Cloche full of smoke</div>
  </div>

  <p>It rested on the table for a minute or two before the bartender came over and slowly swirled the cloche off the top of the pedestal. Underneath was the smokey Manhattan!</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Manhattan</div>
  </div>

  <p>It was seriously smokey. Even though I was only sat next to Hampton, my clothes smelt like a wood fire for the next day.</p>

  <p>The next modernist cocktail we got was the Black Truffle. It came with six tiny spoons. The spoons had a coconut foam/lime dust mixture on them. You were supposed to eat one of those, then drink the gin-based concoction. Those spoons were amazing, and they went well with the drink. The drink had elderflower in it, too, so I loved it.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Black Truffle</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next up, there was a Cedar. It came on a wood platter set up like a zen garden. There was a sprig of cedar in one corner, some cacao &#8220;soil&#8221; and chunks of pear. You dip the pear in the &#8220;soil,&#8221; and eat that before you drink. I didn&#8217;t get much from the food bit, but the drink (a gin-chamomile-pear thing) was clean and fresh.</p>

  <div class="img">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Cedar</div>
  </div>

  <p>I think the weirdest drink of the night was the Spring Thaw. It came in a tiny glass surrounded by moss. The bartender came over and poured water (?) over the moss, and it started misting. I&#8217;m guessing there was perfumed dry ice in there somewhere – it smelled just like a spring forest.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/spring-thaw-mist.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Spring thawing all over the table</div>
  </div>

  <p>The cocktail itself was a gin-campari thing. It had a campari sorbet of some kind, and as you were drinking the sorbet melted into the rest. It&#8217;s a neat concept, but it was strange that the drink got more and more bitter as you went on.</p>

  <div class="img">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">The Spring Thaw cocktail itself</div>
  </div>

  <p>We also got a punch bowl, which I&#8217;d recommend if you&#8217;re tired of the pomp around the other cocktails.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">I love any kind of ceremony or ostentation around food and drink. There&#8217;s something fun about the process – in these cases, eating something special before you drink, or smelling a fog that surrounds your glass. So I&#8217;m already inclined to like a place like this – and I did. A lot. It&#8217;s definitely not cheap, though, and certainly not a casual after-work-drinks kinda place.</span></p>

    <updated>2014-09-16T07:15:28-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/16/daisho</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chang">David Chang&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momofuku_(restaurants)">Momofuku</a> empire grow, but I&rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to eat at one of his restaurants. As he hasn&rsquo;t opened a restaurant in San Francisco, the closest I&rsquo;ve got is reading <a href="http://lky.ph/">Lucky Peach</a>. I was super excited to go to one of his restaurants in Toronto.</p>

<p>There are four Momofuku properties in Toronto – all housed in the same building. In order of increasing fanciness, they are Noodle Bar, Nikai (a cocktail bar), Daishō and Shōtō. The building is pretty cool – it almost looks like an Apple store with its glass exterior and giant Momofuku sign.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/daisho/momofuku.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Momofuku sign</div>
</div>


<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> is going on, and right next to the Momofuku building is the Shangri-la hotel. On its third-floor deck, there was a pre-premiere party for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_(film)">new Reese Witherspoon film</a>. From our table we could see right into the pre-party and had a lot of fun figuring out what it was for. We saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)">Chris Evans</a> there! But we didn&rsquo;t see Reese Witherspoon.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the food. We were eating at Daishō, which has a bunch of smaller dishes plus some larger, 4-10 person plates if you want to do that. They also have a small, but interesting, cocktail list. I got a bijou and it was nicely done (although you couldn&rsquo;t really taste the Chartreuse).</p>

<p>Momofuku is known for its buns, so we got some duck and shrimp versions. It was strange seeing the duck come in patty form – but it tasted absolutely amazing, so I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

</div>


<p>The steak tartare was made with such tender beef. They added enough yolk to keep it glossy, without it being too sloppy. Plus it has sunflower seeds in it which added some nice texture. One of the best tartares I&rsquo;ve had.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Steak tartare</div>
</div>


<p>The other popular thing on the menu is the ssäm (pronounced with a long &ldquo;a&rdquo;, like psalm). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssam">Ssäm</a> is a Korean dish whereby you wrap meat inside a large lettuce leaf. It&rsquo;s a make-your-own lettuce wrap kinda thing. We decided to go for the secreto ssäm, mainly because we didn&rsquo;t know what secreto was (turns out it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Iberian_pig">cut of pork</a>). It was really delicious!</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Secreto Ssäm</div>
</div>


<p>We also ordered some crab cakes, which came out looking a lot more different than I thought. Turns out Korean-style crab cakes aren&rsquo;t patty-shaped. They&rsquo;re long tube-like things that aren&rsquo;t totally unlike crab sticks. They came in a spicy sauce, too.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Korean-style crab cakes</div>
</div>


<p>Despite being fit to burst at this point, we were recommended the crack pie. IT WAS AMAZING. That&rsquo;s about all I can say. If you have an opportunity, get it.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Crack pie</div>
</div>


<p>As well as Daishō, there were a bunch of other awesome places we ate at.</p>

<p><a href="http://guu-izakaya.com/sakabar">Guu Sakabar</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya">izakaya</a>-style bar/restaurant. They have a bunch of smaller dishes on the <a href="http://guu-izakaya.com/docs/sakabar_menu1.pdf">menu</a>, and you order a few each and share. They have a wide range of stuff, from standard (like takoyaki) to weird (udon carbonara?). My favourite was kabocha korokke – a pumpkin croquette thing with a boiled egg in the middle, served with a sauce that was kinda like thousand island dressing.</p>

<p>They had an Ontario-produced sake which I can&rsquo;t find on the menu but it was delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://416snackbar.wordpress.com/">416 Snack Bar</a> is a hipster tapas-style place. They had chalkboard on the walls and don&rsquo;t offer you any cutlery. The best thing here was either the foie torchon or the steak tartare.</p>

<p>The other place I enjoyed was <a href="http://patriatoronto.com/">Patria</a>, a Spanish tapas restaurant (all the places we went to were tapas, it seems). They had great authentic Spanish-style food (even jamón Ibérico!) plus some tasty sangria. We got a cornish hen paella, which was weird but worked pretty well.</p>

<p>These restaurants barely scratch the surface of Toronto, I&rsquo;m sure. We&rsquo;ve eaten really well here, no doubt due to the excellent choices of our friends <a href="http://twitter.com/mferrier">Mike</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">Melissa</a> who pretty much recommended/chose all of these places to eat at.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/15/niagara</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flying to Toronto, I saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls">Niagara Falls</a> as a misty interruption of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_River">Niagara River</a>. Turns out they&rsquo;re only about a 1.5hr drive from Toronto, so we decided to head there for an overnight trip. Extra bonus: to get there you travel through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_wine">Ontario wine country</a>, so we stopped off at a winery on the way back.</p>

<p>Niagara Falls (the town) is very&hellip; commercial. It&rsquo;s almost like a damp Las Vegas. The Canada side (with the better views) has a bunch of casinos, super-tall hotels, chain restaurants. It&rsquo;s a little overwhelming, especially if you imagined it would just be a beautiful waterfall surrounded by nature.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Hilton, which had pretty neat views of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Falls">American Falls</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">View from our room. That&#8217;s the U.S.A. across that bridge!</div>
</div>


<p>We arrived at 6pm, and headed straight for the <a href="http://www.niagaracruises.com/">Hornblower</a>. It&rsquo;s the Canadian version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_of_the_Mist">Maid of the Mist</a> boat.</p>

<p>You take a route up the river, past the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Falls">American Falls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridal_Veil_Falls_(Niagara_Falls)">Bridal Veil Falls</a>.</p>

<p>After that, the boat goes right into the mist spray of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Falls">Horseshoe Falls</a>. <strong>Pro-tip</strong>: if you have contact lenses, wear them. I was running out of dry bits of T-shirt to wipe my glasses with.</p>

<p>After we got off the boat (thankfully it was pretty warm, so we dried quickly), we headed to our evening meal at <a href="http://www.weinkeller.ca/">Weinkeller</a>. But on the way, we passed a haunted house: Dracula&rsquo;s Haunted Castle <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0912213,-79.0744428,3a,75y,21.98h,80.75t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1siKb9ZlIUyOeNtBlIvdj2Tg!2e0">on Clifton Hill</a>. We like that sort of thing, so went inside. It was $10 each, and you can choose your scare level – we chose medium.</p>

<p>We were the only ones in there, and after paying headed up some stairs in pitch-black darkness. The first few rooms are dull – mostly poorly-done wa figures. However, towards the latter half the scare actor(s?) come in. He was amazing – he growled and chased us through the maze. It was pretty terrifying, I have to admit. I&rsquo;ve never been more relieved than seeing those stairs leading to the exit.</p>

<p>Anyway, we continued up Clifton Hill to the restaurant. Turns out haunted houses are a big deal in Niagara Falls. We counted three more on the walk. There was one next door/above Weinkeller, too!</p>

  <div class="alt">Next door to Weinkeller</div>
</div>


<p>Weinkeller is the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurants-g154998-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html">top-rated TripAdvisor restaurant for Niagara Falls</a>. If you use TripAdvisor, I probably don&rsquo;t need to describe the atmosphere – keen service, slightly older clientele, great value, and delicious food. It amuses Hampton and me to compare ratings on TripAdvisor, Yelp, and FourSquare. Each site&rsquo;s audience has subtley different things they look for in a restaurant.</p>

<p>I think the restaurant space used to be a cheap Italian restaurant. The decor was a little&hellip; lacking. Who puts colour-changing lights in a restaurant? But the wait staff were incredible – making jokes, smiling all the time. One of the menu options is a five-course meal but (get this) you can replace up to two of the courses with a glass of wine. Perfect!</p>

<p>Speaking of wine, they make their own. You can see the casks in the back. It was really quite good. The food was amazing. I had some incredible steak tartare, and my main was a super-juicy pork chop. Hampton had a great seared-tuna thing.</p>

<p>After the meal, we walked back to our hotel and grabbed a drink at Myst, the top-floor bar. The drinks were OK. The view was good – but at night Niagara Falls isn&rsquo;t nearly as impressive. They light the falls with a dim rainbow of colours. Super-tacky. You can&rsquo;t really get a good photo, so you&rsquo;ll have to imagine it.</p>

<p>The next morning we did the other Niagara Falls tourist trap: going behind the Horseshoe Falls. Walking close to the edge of the falls was pretty spectacular. The water is much clearer than I thought it was going to be.</p>

</div>


<p>You take a lift down to the bottom of the falls, and it opens up into these dank tunnels.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Tunnels underneath Horseshoe Falls</div>
</div>


<p>You can go outside to just where the falls hit the water, which is extremely loud and incredibly close.</p>

<p>I was always fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall#mediaviewer/File:WaterfallCreationDiagram.svg">waterfall geography</a> (I was a cool kid). It&rsquo;s so strange to think that Niagara Falls started way downstream and has been slowly moving since then.</p>

<p>You walk down some more tunnels to get behind the actual falls. They have a couple of holes cut in the rock and you can look out. But you can&rsquo;t see much – it&rsquo;s mostly a white mist. It&rsquo;s really loud, too.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>After that, we left Niagara Falls. It was fun going there, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d do it again any time soon. A day there was enough to see and do most things, I think.</p>

<p>The drive back to Toronto goes through wine country, so we stopped off at one of Hampton&rsquo;s favourite wineries: <a href="http://www.fieldingestatewinery.ca/">Fielding Estate</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Entrance to Fielding Estate</div>
</div>


<p>Californian wines aren&rsquo;t really our thing. It&rsquo;s nice going to Napa or Sonoma and doing a wine tour, but we prefer whites grown in colder regions. We like whites from the Alsace, Austria, Ontario or Washington. Fielding Estate Winery has some great wines – aromatic and floral, but not too sweet.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/niagara/fielding-inside.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Inside the tasting room/shop</div>
</div>


<p>We tried about six wines in total, and bought four bottles. The gewurztraminer, the viogner, and the Rock Pile Pinot Gris were the best.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Casks of wine</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s an awesome view over the vineyards, too. If we had more time, we would have definitely had a glass outside.</p>

<p>You should definitely visit Fielding Estate if you&rsquo;re in the Niagara area. Or keep an eye out for their wines. They&rsquo;re super-tasty!</p>

<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll be posting about delicious food and drink we&rsquo;ve had since we&rsquo;ve been in Toronto.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/10/north-korean-brandy-cocktail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We made it to Toronto! But more on that later. What&rsquo;s more important is drinking unusual alcohol. While in Toronto, we&rsquo;ve been hanging out with two of our awesome friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/mferrier">Mike</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">Melissa</a>. Last year, they visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ</a>, and <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=6587">bought a bottle of North Korean brandy</a> known as Paekrosul.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/paekrosul.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/paekrosul.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Paekrosul</div>
</div>


<p>Apparently its name translates as <a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/nieminen/chiew.html">&ldquo;Hundred-Years Liquour&rdquo;</a>, which is certainly promising.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/made-in-dprk.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">For realz made in DPR Korea</div>
</div>


<p>The bottle was a little tatty, and it was stoppered with a plastic cork. Inside, there was a bit of sandy sediment. Feeling the risk of going blind was one worth taking, we opened the bottle and poured ourselves a (small) glass.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/glass.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/glass.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Paekrosul, neat</div>
</div>


<p>I thought it smelled a lot like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu">baiju</a>, a Chinese liquour that my Dad always gets as a business gift. Others described it as having more of a turpentine aroma.</p>

<p>Despite its nose-burning smell, it tasted fine. Harsh at first, it quickly becomes sweeter and it didn&rsquo;t have a burning aftertaste that you get with a lot of high-proof drinks. No one really wanted to drink much more than a sip, though. What do you do when you have alcohol that no one&rsquo;s going to drink neat? You make a cocktail of course!</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Time to make a cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>Mike and Melissa have a well-stocked bar, so I had a lot of stuff to work with. But where to begin? I looked online for some brandy cocktails to see if I could modify them. One suggestion was the <a href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/mtropltn_cktl.htm">metropolitan</a> – like a manhattan but with brandy instead of whiskey. I used one part sweet vermouth to three parts Paekrosul, plus some Angostura for good measure. It didn&rsquo;t taste that great, though. As the Paekrosul was sweet already, the vermouth didn&rsquo;t contribute much. Plus the main off-putting thing about Paekrosul was the smell. Neither the vermouth nor the bitters covered that up. Time to try a different route.</p>

<p>My favourite cocktails are all citrus-based. Citrus fruits also tend to have pretty strong aromas, so I thought using lemon or lime might be good.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/citrus.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/citrus.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Adding citrus makes everything better</div>
</div>


<p>I mixed in some lemon juice and it tasted pretty good. It tasted even better if you used a lemon peel as a garnish. Twisting the peel to spray the citrus oil over the drink covered up the turpentine smell pretty well.</p>

<p>I tried it with lime but it didn&rsquo;t work as well – the lime flavour wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p>

<p>I also ended up adding some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointreau">Cointreau triple sec</a> to the mix to add a little more citrus and sweetness.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/cocktail.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/cocktail.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The final drink</div>
</div>


<p>Ta-da! It wasn&rsquo;t the best cocktail I&rsquo;ve ever made, but I think I did a good job of mostly masking the worst flavours of the Paekrosul while keeping its more distinctive flavours. I&rsquo;m pretty sure by next summer it will be on every speakeasy menu from Brooklyn to the Mission.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t come up with a witty name yet, so suggestions are welcome.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Final ingredients</div>
</div>


<p>If you have some Paekrosul , is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 parts Paekrosul</li>
<li>1 part Triple Sec</li>
<li>1 part lemon juice</li>
<li>Stir over ice, serve with an ice cube and lemon peel garnish.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/04/north-paris/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-04T12:36:25-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/04/north-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before we do the North American stint of our journey, we had one final week in our favourite European city: Paris. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly all anxieties about travel or business evaporate when we&rsquo;re sat in a café drinking some wine.</p>

<p>We were staying in an area new to us: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre">Montmartre</a>. We were situated on the north side of the hill, behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_du_Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris">Sacré-Cœur</a>. It was a little tricky (but by no means impossible) to get to other areas that we usually hang out in (mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s">St Germain</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Quarter,_Paris">Latin Quarter</a>) – so we spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/cafe.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/cafe.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Chilling in a café</div>
</div>


<p>One of the first things we did was walk to the Sacré-Cœur. It&rsquo;s something you can see from most of Paris, perched on the top of Montmartre like a wedding cake topper. Neither of us had been before, so we trekked up the few hundred steps to the top.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/sc.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/sc.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">In front of the Sacré-Cœur</div>
</div>


<p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a beautiful church, but the view over Paris? It&rsquo;s&hellip; OK.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">View from the Sacré-Cœur</div>
</div>


<p>Sure, any vista over a city is kinda nice. But there just isn&rsquo;t much variation to make this one that interesting. It&rsquo;s just roofs – and you can maybe pick out the Centre Pompidou or Notre Dame in the distance if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc-annotated.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc-annotated.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">View from the Sacré-Cœur, with annotations!</div>
</div>


<p>The view from the top floor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou">Centre Pompidou</a> is much better, because you can see the stereotypical Parisian apartment buildings right there, but also see the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Sacré-Cœur, etc. in the background. It&rsquo;s a more satisfying view.</p>

<p>In short, the Sacré-Cœur looks perfectly fine from far away and I wouldn&rsquo;t bother climbing up all those steps unless you&rsquo;re really into churches.</p>

<p>Another touristy thing we did was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Orsay">Musée d&#8217;Orsay</a>. Housed in an old train station, it&rsquo;s renowned as one of the best collections of impressionist and post-impressionist art in the world. I&rsquo;d visited the museum before, and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy it. I was in a rush and (post-)impressionism isn&rsquo;t really my thing. Plus the queues for tickets are notorious – I&rsquo;ve heard stories of 2+ hours in line.</p>

<p>We were wandering past on a Thursday at 2pm and there was no line whatsoever for tickets. Apparently that&rsquo;s the time to go! On a whim, we went inside.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/orsay.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/orsay.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Musée d&#8217;Orsay</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s a gorgeous building, and the layout is innovative. The central aisle has sculptures and off the sides are the paintings. I must admit, I enjoyed the museum a lot more this time around. There was still a lot of stuff I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, but I found an appreciation for the &ldquo;greats&rdquo; – Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Van Gogh.</p>

<p>It was funny seeing the Orsay&rsquo;s Van Gogh collection – which completely blew away the collection of the Van Gogh Museum we visited in Amsterdam. Every classic painting is here – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#mediaviewer/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><strong>the</strong> self-portrait</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone">Starry Night over the Rhone</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_at_Auvers">The Church at Auvers</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Dr._Gachet">less-expensive Portrait of Dr Gachet</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Hell">plaster original of the Gates of Hell</a> by Rodin is also there, which is probably my favourite piece in the museum. During the visit, I went from completely hating the museum to thinking it&rsquo;s one of my favourites in Paris.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never toured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides">Les Invalides</a>, the building complex which houses the military history museum and home of Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb. We did that mostly to check off Parisian tourist things I hadn&rsquo;t yet done.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/tomb.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/tomb.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Tomb of Napoleon, Les Invalides</div>
</div>


<p>If you&rsquo;re super into military history, you should go. I&rsquo;m&hellip; not, so the museum left me a little bored. The tomb of Napoleon was kinda cool, but that&rsquo;s about it. Oh, there was a sub-museum dedicated to the life of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>. It gushed about him, which was creepy enough, but both Hampton and I thought it left a negative impression of him by the end of it. He came across as a little dictatorial, to be honest. I need to read more about his time in politics to get a better grasp of what he did.</p>

<p>Anyway, we mostly spent our days drinking wine and coffee in cafés, which is a fine way to spend a week. Off to Toronto (by way of one night in Philadelphia) next!</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/29/halfway-ish-thoughts-so-far/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-29T03:28:24-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/29/halfway-ish-thoughts-so-far</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re about to head back to North America. That&rsquo;s right, the European leg of our 2014 journey is almost over. In a lot of ways, I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving. I feel a little short-changed – we only had <em>one day</em> in Vienna? Why didn&rsquo;t we make it to Budapest? Should we have spent time in a random British city, too?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the next leg of our trip: the East Coast. I&rsquo;m excited to learn more about Toronto and New York. I can&rsquo;t wait to drive down the East Coast as autumn descends and the leaves change. I&rsquo;m looking foward to using a more familiar currency, and for things to be not so expensive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking ahead to being back in San Francisco – being <em>home</em>. Travel is a lot of fun, and we&rsquo;re extremely aware of how lucky we are to be doing it, but it&rsquo;s quite exhausting and has a lot of anxiety associated with it. I&rsquo;ll probably write another post about that, though.</p>

<p>But now, we&rsquo;re at a half-way point in our travels. It&rsquo;s not literally a half-way point – we&rsquo;ve spent more time in Europe than we will on the East Coast – but it&rsquo;s close enough and is, if anything, almost a thematic half-way point. So I decided to do a bit of reflection on the packing aspect of travelling – whether I&rsquo;m regretting bringing that electric toothbrush, or how I feel about living out of a carry-on bag.</p>

<h3>Living from a carry-on</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad, to be honest. I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of the clothes I have, and some of them are a little bit worse-for-wear, but all in all it&rsquo;s fine. So far I&rsquo;ve not had the Fight Club-esque &ldquo;I want to get rid of more stuff&rdquo; epiphany, but I have thought about slimming down on some clothes at home, and definitely getting rid of some of our stuff in storage (do we <em>really</em> need all those wires?).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny that we&rsquo;ve been checking our bags for most of our European flights. It started because we were mainly flying with EasyJet, which has a strict one-bag-only policy. There was no way we could fit our laptop bags in our carry-ons, so we checked them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also been buying liquids in bigger quantities than we could take on the flight. Things like travel-sized shaving foam aren&rsquo;t always easy to come by, and it feels wasteful buying a whole can of foam just to throw it away after a couple of uses.</p>

<p>Having said that, using the carry-on as a &ldquo;way-of-mind,&rdquo; if you will, has been great. I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t pack a larger suitcase if I did this again. It&rsquo;s far more convenient to have a smaller bag when navigating small hotel rooms or getting on a train.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d brought</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things I wish I&rsquo;d brought – but to be honest, they&rsquo;ve been fairly easy to find abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Cups/re-useable bottle</strong> – in some AirBnB places we&rsquo;ve stayed in, they only had tiny water glasses. Most of the time, we&rsquo;ve ended up buying big bottles and refilling them. We bought two medium-sized plastic tumblers to take around in case we needed a mixed drink or something to pour into. They come in handy in hotel rooms, too!</p>

<p><strong>More bad shirts</strong> – I brought all my favourite shirts. Maybe this is just me, but I feel weird wearing my favourite stuff every day. They&rsquo;re already starting to get a little tatty. I wish I had some more simple shirts that I could easily throw away at the end of this trip.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d left</h3>

<p><strong>Some contact lenses</strong> – I really overpacked for contact lenses. I brought enough to wear every other day, and I&rsquo;ve barely used them. I guess I thought I&rsquo;d be wearing my sunglasses more often.</p>

<p><strong>Running shorts</strong> – yeah, that was wishful thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Three shirts</strong> – (a.k.a. dress shirts or button-downs) I just don&rsquo;t wear these as much as I thought I would. I brought one ironable shirt and two non. I just don&rsquo;t wear the ironable one because it&rsquo;s too much hassle. I think one shirt would be plenty.</p>

<p>Summer is wrapping up in Europe and I&rsquo;m starting to wear my heavier clothes again. But for a while, when it was 30ºC-plus every day in Prague, I cursed myself for bringing a woolen jumper and a heavy cardigan. Much like in a few months, I will probably be wondering why I brought shorts (although I did wear them a bunch!).</p>

<h3>Things I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> glad I brought</h3>

<p><strong>T-Mobile SIM card</strong> – I can&rsquo;t sing the praises of (the USA company) T-Mobile enough; we switched to them just before we left the USA.  They have unlimited 3G data and texts for a large number of countries, including every country we&rsquo;ve visited. Being able to use Google Maps, or check your e-mail, without having to worry about paying through the nose for every single megabyte is incredibly relieving.</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong> – this might be obvious for people who have and love their iPads. I was never that into my iPad, but waiting in airports, taking train journeys, and other such times have made be really appreciate it.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/23/stockholm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We spent a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and I really recommend checking the conference out. Although I&rsquo;ve been to Sweden once before, I&rsquo;ve never been to Stockholm so I was pretty excited to check out this new city.</p>

<p>Stereotypes about Sweden that are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s cold – it was summer but it was 18ºC most days</li>
<li>everything is expensive</li>
<li>people wear brightly-coloured trousers (was that just a stereotype I had?)</li>
</ul>


<p>I like Sweden a lot. It&rsquo;s far more multicultural than I first expected (I had images of streets and streets filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed Scandanavians). Stockholm isn&rsquo;t as tourist-y as the last few places we&rsquo;ve been, either. It was refreshing at dinner to hear people around you speaking Swedish rather than English.</p>

<p>We only really had time for one day of touring, and when Hampton and I tour a city, we take it seriously. We looked up the top three things to do in Stockholm and made it a priority to check them off.</p>

<p>Stockholm is built on a bunch of islands – an archipelago, really. The centralmost island is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan">Gamla Stan</a>, &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo;. It has winding cobbled streets and alleyways and it&rsquo;s also the home of the royal palace. That&rsquo;s where we started our walking tour.</p>

  </a>

</div>


<p></p>

<p>It was pretty, but full of tourist shops. We quickly headed over to the neighbouring island to check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Museet">Moderna Museet</a>. Although not as big as, say, MoMA or the Tate Modern, the collection is really good. It&rsquo;s manageable in size but also offers a great narrative over 20th century art.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Calder sculptures outside the museum</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we island hopped again – this time taking a ferry to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_museum">Vasa Museum</a>. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund">theme park</a> on the island – but it wasn&rsquo;t open. Sad times!</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)">Vasa</a> was a ship built in 1620s in preparation for a war against Poland. On its maiden voyage, it sank about 20 minutes after setting sail. It lay in the Stockholm bay for over 300 years, until it was recovered in the 1960s. It&rsquo;s still undergoing restoration and preservation, and it&rsquo;s housed in its own museum.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the largest intact boats on display from the 1600s, and it&rsquo;s in great shape.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Intricate carvings on the back of the Vasa</div>
</div>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s some areas of slightly lighter wood on the image above (the post on the top-left, and the cherub mid-right). Those are where the original carvings fell off and they re-carved them from new wood. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think that the rest of the carvings remained like that from when they were made in 1628.</p>

<p>Finally we headed back to the city centre (just north of gamla stan) for some food. We ate at a great Scandinavian restaurant called <a href="http://www.rolfskok.se/?lang=en">Rolf&rsquo;s Kök</a>. I had a super-rich ox cheek dish, and Hampton had a creamy fish stew. Both were delicious!</p>

</div>


<p>After that, we realised that there was a <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/mikkeller-stockholm/">Mikkeller Bar</a> nearby. A Mikkeller Bar recently opened in San Francisco, but we never went. Why not go now, when we&rsquo;re half-way around the world?! So we went. I had a tasty IPA. Hampton tried asking the bartender if they had a British-style ale, but got a sassy reply, so had some wine instead.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Viking 25 IPA</div>
</div>


<p>As if to remind me how silly it was going to a bar that&rsquo;s in my home city, they had the <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/01/13/mikkeller-introduces-mission-chinese-food-beer/">Mission Chinese</a> lager on the board, too.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mission Chinese beer</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we tried to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail. Pro-tip: don&rsquo;t try to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail in Stockholm. Cocktails are extremely expensive (think $20 up). We ended up in a hotel bar and got an overly-sweet Manhattan that barely covered the bottom of the glass it was served in.</p>

<p><em>Having said that</em>, we did get a list of cocktail bar recommendations from someone in Stockholm. We&rsquo;ll have to go back, if only to do a local&rsquo;s tour. Most of them seemed to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6dermalm">Södermalm</a>, which is apparently the hipster area of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Anyway, we had a lot of fun in the city and I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving so soon. Like Vienna, I want to make a point of visiting again, and staying longer next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a flight back to England, where we&rsquo;ll be spending the late August bank holiday weekend. After that, it&rsquo;s Paris for a week then back to the USA! It&rsquo;s strange how quickly this time has gone – it seems like no time has passed since we left San Francisco. However, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of travel left – our trip moving south along the East Coast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a great indoor market called <a href="http://www.markthalleneun.de/">Markthalle Neun</a> that&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=10953314371184579858&amp;q=Markthalle+Neun+GmbH&amp;ei=3sHwU4q8BLDQ7Aa4tYDgCg&amp;ved=0CL0BEPwSMA4">a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying</a>. It&rsquo;s not a traditional market in that there are people selling stuff every day. On a normal day there&rsquo;s a handful of stands or mini-kitchens selling locally-made food, wine, and other stuff.</p>

<p>On Thursdays, however, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;street food&rdquo; gathering where a lot more people show up. All the booths are filled with people selling their food – everything from pancakes to samosas to steamed buns. There&rsquo;s also a couple of food trucks outside, too. It gets incredibly packed, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s also a Sunday morning &ldquo;breakfast market,&rdquo; which has more of a focus on breakfast foods.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been to a couple of these events, but mostly we go on weekdays for lunch. There&rsquo;s such a wide variety of food there it&rsquo;s difficult to go wrong. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve taken pictures of pretty much everything I&rsquo;ve eaten there, so this will mainly be a bunch of pictures of delicious food.</p>

<p>The best thing I&rsquo;ve had so far has been the barbeque from <a href="http://www.bigstuff.de/">Big Stuff Smoked BBQ</a>. It blew away most of the BBQ I&rsquo;ve had in the USA.</p>

<p>There was a Vietnamese stall that did rice-stuffed rolls and some steamed buns.</p>

<p>There was a great vegetarian burger place. We accidentally went there because it had the shortest queue. Then we found out it was vegetarian, almost left, but stuck with it. The burger was so good! I think it was tofu or something, but it was mainly tasty cause they slathered it in peanut sauce.</p>

  <div class="alt">The best veggie-burger I&#8217;ve ever had</div>
</div>


<p>The next place I went to, I had their veggie-burger but it sucked, so I went back to eating all meat all the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m English so I love savoury pies. What luck! There was a pie place in the market. I got a cheese and mince one and it was SO GOOD. I would eat ten more right now.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Cheese and mince pie (note: not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie">that kind of mince pie</a>, which would probably be gross with cheese in it)</div>
</div>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t like pies (like Hampton), you can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">reuben sandwich</a>! It had pastrami on it. Apparently this guy from Portland moved to Berlin and was upset he couldn&rsquo;t get decent pastrami&hellip; so he opened a deli!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fancy savoury items? Well there&rsquo;s a tonne of sweet stuff, too. There&rsquo;s a great waffle place.</p>

<div class="img">

<p>Usually I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of waffles, but these were so good. Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Oh, and covered in caramel sauce.</p>

<p>The waffle place also did some crazy ice-creams&hellip;</p>

<p>And there was a lady selling ice-lollies (or &ldquo;popsicles&rdquo;).</p>

<p>OK, that&rsquo;s all my Markthalle photos. We did eat some fancy food as well – at <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a>. I really like the interior of this place. It&rsquo;s in a warehouse and has lots of industrial touches – like giant chains hanging from the ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also bright due to the large windows and white canvases on the walls.</p>

<p>We went for a four-course Chef&rsquo;s surprise menu. It was a great choice – full of interesting flavours and ingredients that I&rsquo;d never come across before. Here&rsquo;s some pictures:</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Lemon sorbet, chocolate-covered marscapone ice-cream</div>
</div>


<p>It was super-tasty and you should definitely go if you&rsquo;re in the area. Get an apéritif on the beach beforehand!</p>

<p>Our time in Berlin is almost over, and next we&rsquo;ll be heading off to Stockholm for <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>.</p>
