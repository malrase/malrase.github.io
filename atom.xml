    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are in London for a few nights and squeezing in as many activities as possible. Obviously, a major focus of this was drinking. Finding cocktails here is pretty easy compared with continental Europe – within a few blocks of where we&rsquo;re staying there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/">Happiness Forgets</a> and <a href="http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/">Callooh Callay</a>, both excellent cocktail bars.</p>

<p>However, I was most excited about visiting <a href="http://barnightjar.com">Nightjar</a>. We were recommended it by a friend in San Francisco. The menu online looked interesting, so I booked a table. There&rsquo;s no standing in the bar, and you have to have a table to get service. I booked about four days before, on a Tuesday, and could only get a table at 6pm.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s behind an unassuming door <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=nightjar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=3FyPU4TXOsXhPPGVgKAI&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw">just near Old Street underground station</a>. The bouncer checks your name against a list, and sends you downstairs. After being in the daylight, heading down a candle-lit staircase was a little disorienting. At the bottom of the stairs, the maitre d&#8217; (is that even what they&rsquo;re called in a cocktail bar?) welcomed us and sat us down at a small table next to a cabinet of old liqueuers.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>The menu had an incredible cover, with the Nightjar appearing on it multiple times. Throughout the night the silhouette of the bird was a recurring theme – punched into lemon-rinds or branded on the side of a mug.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Menu</div>
</div>


<p>The menu was extensive, sorted by pre-prohibition, prohibition, post-war and signature drinks. Most of the cocktails had at least one ingredient I&rsquo;d never heard of. It took us a while to decide what to go for, but the bartender was helpful in pointing you towards certain things. With her help, I chose the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/new-orleans-daisy">New Orleans Daisy</a> as it had chartreuse in it – but the bartender suggested I take it with gin. Turns out it comes in an owl-shaped container with a candied hibiscus flower and a peacock feather.</p>

</div>


<p>It was really quite incredible. It had an almost buttery flavour with a nectar aftertaste.</p>

<p>Our friend went for the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/london-mule">London Mule</a>. The picture below doesn&rsquo;t quite grasp the size of the mug: it was probably about 12 inches high. Most of that was packed ice. It was a great interpretation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mule">mule</a>-style of drink.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>Hampton got a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/toronto">Toronto</a>, which was similar to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned">Old Fashioned</a> but with maple syrup as the sweetener. It also had a candy-floss nest with some mini-eggs in it.</p>

</div>


<p>I noticed another table received a cocktail in some sort of two-neck condensing flask. I asked what it was, and it&rsquo;s called the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/foragers-shrub">Forager&rsquo;s Shrub</a>. Of course I went for that next.</p>

  <div class="alt">Forager&#8217;s Shrub in flask</div>
</div>


<p>The cocktail itself was in the bigger flask. In the internal, smaller bulb was an oil with some dry ice (I think). It produced a vapour which I was instructed to smell. It smelt of pine and nettles, like a forest after some rain.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/foragers-shrub2.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Must-smell item</div>
</div>


<p>The bartender then poured the drink out – the fragrant oil into a chalice and the drink itself into a tumbler with ice. I was instructed to smell the oils before drinking. Sure, it was fairly pretentious but here&rsquo;s the thing – the smell made it taste different. And the cocktail was amazing, so I didn&rsquo;t care if I looked like a wally.</p>

  <div class="alt">The final cocktail (yes that&#8217;s a mini corn on the cob)</div>
</div>


<p>My last drink was a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/marmalade-no-2">Marmalade Nº 2</a>. It tasted exactly like a Seville orange marmalade – acidic, bitter, bursting with orange flavour. I loved it.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/marmalade-2.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Marmalade Nº 2</div>
</div>


<p>Other drinks we had but I didn&rsquo;t take pictures of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/bloody-mary">Bloody Mary</a> – served in a hollowed-out squash (you can almost see it behind the Marmalade Nº 2 above)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/name-samurai">Name of the Samurai</a> &ndash; served in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake_set">ochoko</a> set inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masu_(Japanese)">masu</a> which had burnt herbs inside</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/secret-cocktail">Secret Cocktail</a> – a gin/egg white combination that was pretty tasty, but had icing sugar around the whole glass so was impossible to drink without getting sticky</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/deep-sea">Deep Sea</a> &ndash; had squid ink in it, and had nori around the rim of the glass</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/prairie-flip">Prarie Flip</a> – had a garnish of a boiled quail&rsquo;s egg and had a weird garlicky taste&hellip; not sure I&rsquo;d recommend this one</li>
</ul>


<p>The cocktails weren&rsquo;t too expensive – between £8 and £12 was the average. Considering that such care went into not only the flavours, but also the decoration and presentation, I found it to be a worthwhile treat. I can see Hampton and I coming back here whenever we&rsquo;re in London.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Drinking in the Costa Del Sol]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/29/drinking-costa-del-sol/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-29T10:37:41+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/29/drinking-costa-del-sol</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The next stage of our trip took us to the south of Spain – the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_del_Sol">Costa del Sol</a>,&rdquo; a clichéd destination for sun-starved Brits. My family were meeting us there and spending a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijas">Mijas</a> – a small village scattered on mountains overlooking the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Our fruitful cocktail hunt in Paris was great. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to push our luck, so we decided to try some more traditional drinks while in a less cosmopolitan area.</p>

<p>First up: fino. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fino">Fino</a> is a dry sherry served very cold. It&rsquo;s taken as an apéretif, and apparently it&rsquo;s what all the locals drink. I&rsquo;m a fan of sherry, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/fino.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Glass of fino</div>
</div>


<p>With regular sherry, the sweetness cuts through some of the flavour of the alcohol, which makes it palatable to me. With fino, you could definitely taste the alcohol compared with &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; sherry. The fino started with a sharp acidity, then followed with a fresher aftertaste. If I lived in Spain, I&rsquo;d probably get used to it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily order it again.</p>

<p>Next up, at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g580271-d2413104-Reviews-Pampa_Tablas_y_Tapas-Mijas_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html">a local tapas bar called Pampa</a>, we tried the stereotypical Spanish alcoholic drink: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangria">sangria</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/sangria.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Glass and pitcher of sangria</div>
</div>


<p>Sangria is awesome and I presume everyone has had it. If not, you should try it. It&rsquo;s traditionally made with red wine, brandy, and some kind of sweetener. You also put in pieces of chopped fruit. However, I believe this one had some rum in it as well. I&rsquo;ll try adding rum when I next make sangria at home, cause it added a nice kick.</p>

<p>On our final night, we went to a &ldquo;gin bar.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a slight misnomer: for one, it&rsquo;s more of a tapas place, and for two it served other alcohol as well. But gin is where this place shone. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/06/daily-chart-9">Spain is one of the highest per capita consumers of gin</a> (other fun facts from the linked infographic: India is the largest consumer of rum, and France is the largest consumer of Scotch). So, despite being a traditionally British drink, we had some Spanish-style gin and tonics.</p>

<p>The bar we were at, <a href="http://www.bodegaelplacer.com/">Bodega El Placer</a>, had about thirty gins on offer. There were five of us and we asked for five different gins, so we could sample them all. Each gin came in a big glass with ice and individually-prepared garnishes.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/just-gin.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Gin with garnishes</div>
</div>


<p>The garnishes ranged from juniper berries, cinnamon sticks and cardamom seeds to a simple lemon slice. The gins were all pretty different. Luckily, I liked a deep-flavoured sour gin that no one else enjoyed, so I didn&rsquo;t have to fight to finish that one off. I believe it was <a href="http://www.bulldoggin.com/">Bulldog gin</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/tonic-regular.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Gin and tonic</div>
</div>


<p>Fun fact: in most of Europe, when you want a gin and tonic, you just say &ldquo;gintonic.&rdquo; All one word.</p>

<p>They also had a blue tonic, but I&rsquo;m not really sure what the difference between regular tonic and the blue stuff was. I was a bad scientist and didn&rsquo;t do a same-gin, different-tonic experiment.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/tonic-blue.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Blue tonic?!</div>
</div>


<p>I should also mention the tapas: it was really good. It was more inventive than I was expecting – they had tempura aubergine with a honey sauce, and a melt-in-your-mouth tuna sashimi plate. My favourite, of course, was the jamón. It was one of the better jamón ibérico we had while in Spain.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/jamon.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Jamón ibérico</div>
</div>


<p>We were only in Spain a few days. Despite that, we managed to do two excellent day trips: one to Granada to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a> (check out some photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/malrase/sets/72157644507980879/">on Flickr</a>), and one to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/malrase/sets/72157644507822700/">Flickr photos</a>). If you&rsquo;re ever in the south of Spain, I highly recommend taking a trip to those. I also hear Seville is great, but we didn&rsquo;t make it there.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now on our way to the UK, which I&rsquo;m worried will be a bit of a shock. We&rsquo;re leaving sunny, 24ºC weather and heading towards a rainy 10ºC.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/25/early-morning-cdg-flight/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-25T12:59:34+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/25/early-morning-cdg-flight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We realised we had booked two early-morning flights from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport">Charles de Gaulle</a>, the main airport for Paris. We looked up if the metro/RER was running that early, but from our stop the times didn&rsquo;t work out. So the RER wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find much online, bar a few out-of-date forum posts, on alternative methods for getting to CDG that early, so I thought I&rsquo;d write our experiences down.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Shared Taxi</h2>

<p>For our first flight we got a shared taxi, using <a href="http://www.wecab.com">WeCab</a>. It was pretty simple to order online. You decide by what time you want to arrive at the airpot (we chose 6:30am, for a 7:15am flight). Then they give you a window during which they will pick you up. Our window was half an hour wide (5:25am to 5:55am), but as we are staying on the other side of Paris we expected the taxi would show up closer to 5:25am.</p>

<p>The cab showed up at 5:20am (!), and we had to rush a little to get out the door. The service said they would text 5 minutes before the taxi arrived, but they didn&rsquo;t. Thankfully, we were staying in a ground floor flat with a view of the road and I noticed the driver waiting outside.</p>

<p>We only picked up one other couple (the taxi had room for seven people), and we arrived at the airport with plenty of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: €46.30 for two (~$62)</li>
<li><strong>Wake-up time</strong>: 5:05am (for 7:20am flight)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Option 2: Hotel</h2>

<p>For our second flight, we decided to get a room in a hotel airport. We chose the <a href="http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-1404-ibis-paris-cdg-airport/index.shtml">ibis CDG Airport</a> – it&rsquo;s pretty much at Terminal 3, and was about a 15-minute trip (CDGVAL terminal shuttle and walking) to our check-in gate.</p>

<p>Our flight was on a Sunday, so we arrived at the hotel on the Saturday. Despite advertising a lot of food options, there was only one buffet for lunch so we ended up going into the airport itself for lunch. That evening, only <em>one</em> of the restaurants was open, with a 30-minute wait time for food and a long line out the door. Pretty poor, to be honest.</p>

<p>We were on an EasyJet flight to Malága, so we had to get to the airport pretty early. On EasyJet, you&rsquo;re only allowed one carry-on (not one suitcase and one laptop bag, <strong>just one</strong> bag). Baggage drop closes 40 mins before departure, and gates close 30 mins before departure. So we had to be there earlier than our previous flight. However, we still managed to get up later.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: €97 for two (~$132)</li>
<li><strong>Wake-up time</strong>: 5:30am (for 7:00am flight)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite the hotel we chose having a number of flaws, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend getting a hotel rather than the early-morning cab.</p>

<p>The peace of mind knowing you&rsquo;re in the airport complex, plus the convenience of a 15-minute automated train and walking journey, far outweigh the difference in price.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/24/cocktails-in-paris/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-24T13:08:01+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/24/cocktails-in-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Living in San Francisco, we&rsquo;re spoiled when it comes to cocktails. Almost any bar you wander into could make a half-decent manhattan or gimlet. As <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/13/linz">I&rsquo;ve brought up before</a>, cocktails in Europe are a little lacking. Hampton and I wanted to find some decent mixed drinks, so did some research on the cocktail scene in Paris.</p>

<p>There are a handful of well-rated places, and we learnt that the first high-end cocktail bar to be successful was the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Experimental-Cocktail-Club/129531980432588">Experimental Cocktail Club</a> (&ldquo;ECC&rdquo;), which has been open for about six years. Apparently, a number of trainee bartenders from there have spread across the city, opening their own high-end cocktail bars. We went to three (alas, we didn&rsquo;t make it to the ECC).</p>

<p>We ended up at the similarly-named <a href="http://www.prescriptioncocktailclub.com/">Prescription Cocktail Club</a>, in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prescription+Cocktail+Club/@48.854997,2.337909,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9d147b310bda215">Saint Germain quarter</a>, as it was close to one of our favourite restaurants in Paris (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-la-boissonnerie-paris-2">Fish la Boissonnerie</a>). There was no obvious sign from the street that it was a cocktail bar, but we were pretty sure we had the right address. We peered in a window and saw a bunch of people sipping cocktails, so we went in. Although we showed up at 9pm on a Friday, we were lucky enough to get a table. The service was pretty good (there was table service at every bar we went to), and the cocktails were competent. I ordered something with gin, green Chartreuse, and crème de menthe. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but drinkable nontheless.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lemaryceleste.com/">Mary Celeste</a> was another bar we went to. It had pretty good cocktails and some tasty-looking tapas – we&rsquo;d just eaten so we&rsquo;ll have to go back for the food.</p>

<p>The bizarrely-named <a href="http://www.sherrybuttparis.com/">Sherry Butt</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sherry+Butt/@48.853303,2.364085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e671ffaa10ef7d:0x2b98a01f163bffd1">not far from Bastille</a>, was probably my favourite cocktail bar that we went to. We went on a Thursday night and it was really quiet (being quiet is definitely a bonus for us). The bar was set up like a workshop – unfinished wood tables and odd contraptions on shelves. The menu was inventive and they seemed to produce a lot of their own syrups and flavourings for their drinks. Although they only listed their own concoctions, I asked for a Last Word and the bartender didn&rsquo;t hesitate to make one. The bartender was super-friendly and explained to us the cocktail scene in Paris – about how the &ldquo;ECC&rdquo; started it all, and that most of the high-end bartenders originated there. He was surprised we hadn&rsquo;t been to Candelaria, and strongly recommended we go there next.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candelariaparis.com/">Candelaria</a>, just <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Candelaria/@48.862981,2.364034,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfe5e1d4c40b38ec0">south of République</a>, is a pretty strange place. It reminded me of something you&rsquo;d find in San Francisco. From the street, it&rsquo;s a tiny, bright taqueria. There&rsquo;s one table and a handful of seats at a bar. At 9pm on a Thursday night, it was packed. People were spilling out onto the street, and we were told it would be a 30min wait if we wanted food. However, we were there for the cocktails.</p>

<p>If you squeeze past the people sitting at the diner-style bar, there&rsquo;s an unmarked door. Go through it and you&rsquo;re in a much larger room – although equally busy – lit by candles. The space was decorated with Day-of-the-Dead style skeletons and it really did feel like we were back in the Mission. Unfortunately, the cocktails were mediocre. We hadn&rsquo;t reserved a table ahead, so we were stuck standing elbow-to-elbow with the hipsters of Paris. It was a little clostrophobic in there.</p>

<p>We went to another cocktail bar/tapas restaurant nearby Candelaria: <a href="http://www.lemaryceleste.com/cocktails/">Le Mary Celeste</a>. As far as I know, the bartenders weren&rsquo;t ECC alumni, but they had a neat cocktail menu. The bar had a vaguely nautical theme, and the cocktails were refreshing – both on-menu and classics like a manhattan or a gimlet. If you&rsquo;re in the area, and want to get away from the intensity of Candelaria, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a good call.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that cocktails in Paris are expensive. €13 (~$18) was not unusual. Compare that to cocktails in San Francisco, where anything more than $12 would be considered pricey. It&rsquo;s a trade-off, obviously – the price of a baguette (80¢ or ~$1.10) or some great cheese is way less in Paris than in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy we found these places. Most were a little tricky to track down, but fun to drink at. It&rsquo;s good to know there are decent cocktial bars in Paris – even if you have to walk down a weird side-alley to get to them. I look forward to finding more next time we&rsquo;re in the city.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/19/street-art-butte-aux-cailles/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-19T11:43:05+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/19/street-art-butte-aux-cailles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our first major stop in Europe has been Paris. We&rsquo;re staying in an area new to us: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte-aux-Cailles">la Butte-aux-Cailles</a>. It&rsquo;s in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_arrondissement_of_Paris">13th arrondissement</a> of Paris, in the south-east of the city.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood has a small-town feel, and isn&rsquo;t touristy at all. I&rsquo;ve only encountered other English-speakers when I&rsquo;ve left the area. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to get to other places, as the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_d'Italie">Place d&#8217;Italie</a> has a number of lines from its Métro stop.</p>

<p>There are a decent number of bars, cafés and restaurants on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+de+la+Butte+aux+Cailles/@48.8277143,2.3498739,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e67190f05e1315:0x4771112c8d0bf60b">the main street</a>. From about 6pm to midnight, they&rsquo;re packed with people – so much so, that there&rsquo;s often a crowd spilling out onto the street. It&rsquo;s a little strange for a neighbourhood that&rsquo;s fairly quiet the rest of the time.</p>

<p>Anyway, the thing that struck me the most about the area was that it seems to have a large amount of street art (apparently <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-26/how-overprotective-paris-became-the-center-of-street-art-.html">Paris is becoming the &ldquo;center of street art&rdquo;</a>). Every wall seems to have something beautiful or provocative on it.</p>

<p>The most famous (as far as I can tell) street art in the area is done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampsa_(street_artist)">Sampsa</a>, the &ldquo;Finnish Banksy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two pieces by Sampsa were in protest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law">HADOPI law</a> – a copyright infringement law from around 2009. Amusingly, the first logo for the HADOPI agency used <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6974249/Anti-piracy-agencys-logo-broke-copyright.html">a typeface without appropriate licensing</a>.</p>

<p>The mosquito art was <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/paris-censored-anti-copyright-street-art">censored for a while</a> – removing the &ldquo;Blood sucking HADOPI&rdquo; line. But apparently it has been recently restored.</p>

<p>There are a bunch artworks done in mostly muted blues and greys. They&rsquo;re all of children. At first glance, they&rsquo;re kind of peaceful.</p>

</div>


<p>However when I started to study them there was something unnerving about them. The children never had faces.</p>

</div>


<p>As well as the lack of faces, the children are usually disappearing. They&rsquo;re walking through a waterfall or curtain into another world. Or they&rsquo;re being partially submerged. They&rsquo;re a little eerie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.missticinparis.com/">Miss.tic</a> is another artist with a lot of works in the area. According to <a href="http://www.missticinparis.com/misstic_biographie.html">her biography page</a>, she&rsquo;s almost 60 years old. She has a bunch of stencils that tend to be of provocatively-posed ladies with humourous or ironic captions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done my best to translate the captions, but they&rsquo;ll no doubt be a little off. If anyone wants to correct me, please do!</p>

<p>I liked these, although the prisoner is just around a tight corner, and at night I keep thinking there&rsquo;s a person waiting there. It&rsquo;s a little creepy.</p>

<p>There are a few pieces by <a href="http://www.janaundjs.com/">Jana und JS</a>. They have a nice style, and do work in a number of European cities. I like their focus on photography/photographers, who appear in a lot of their works.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a small gecko logo next to a lot of the art. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what the symbol is for – looking up the <a href="http://www.lezarts-bievre.com/">Lézarts de la Bièvre</a>, it seems to be some kind of art event held in June, with a focus on street artists.</p>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s a bunch of other neat stuff I saw that seemed to be one-offs by artists (at least, one-offs for this area).</p>

<p>Anyway, I <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/48.8310625,2.3552585/48.8280933,2.3526657/48.8266199,2.3479307/48.8290213,2.3478663/48.8288321,2.3507471/48.8310907,2.3552156/@48.8292438,2.3512191,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e2">google-mapped</a> (Is &ldquo;google-map&rdquo; a verb? It is now, I guess) the route I took. It starts and ends at Place d&#8217;Italie, in case you&rsquo;re arriving by Métro, and takes about 30 minutes. Of course, just wandering around the neighbourhood – especially on a Sunday morning, when it&rsquo;s super-quiet – is nice too.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re leaving this area in the next couple of days to move to a hotel for <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">La Conf</a>. After that, it&rsquo;s off to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> to meet my family.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-13T12:33:20+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/13/vienna</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We took the <a href="https://westbahn.at/en/">Westbahn</a> from Linz to Vienna. It leaves every 30mins and takes about 1hr 20mins to get there. The train was swish – clean, with free wi-fi, power ports next to every seat. Plus a conductor (?) came through so you could buy tickets and drinks/snacks. I wish all trains were this nice.</p>

<p>It was pouring when we arrived in Vienna, so although we only had around 24hrs there, we didn&rsquo;t do much during the afternoon. However, that night we had a <a href="http://twitter.com/bastilian">friend</a> to take us to a restaurant and some bars.</p>

<p><a href="http://ulrichwien.at/">Ulrich</a> was a neat restaurant that wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place in San Francisco. It had clean, hip decor and a menu focusing on quality ingredients. The roast chicken was so good (but can you go wrong when you offer a side of bernaise with something?). We then went to <a href="http://www.barflys.at/en/">Barflys</a>, which I&rsquo;d read about as one of the top cocktail bars in Vienna. It&rsquo;s hidden in a hotel, but the cocktails are pretty decent, with more of a focus on US-stye than Cocktailbar Easy (I didn&rsquo;t see one pineapple wedge). However, it was a small room and allows smoking, so&hellip; it was a little suffocating in there.</p>

<p>Finally, we went to <a href="http://www.donautechno.com/main/">Donnau Techno</a>. It&rsquo;s behind an un-marked door in a quiet alley. Inside had an &ldquo;East Berlin&rdquo; feel – the floor was concrete and the furniture was fairly cheap. Ice was served from a bucket. There was a stand in the corner that sold sausages and pickles. The interior had vaulted ceilings and columns, and onto the walls were projected images. Apparently they change every night, as does the techno DJ behind a make-shift booth. We were there on a Sunday, so it was fairly quiet, but apparently it gets packed almost every other night of the week.</p>

<p>The next morning it was beautiful out, so Sebastian took us on a quick yet thorough walking tour of Vienna. We started in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumsquartier">Museumsquartier</a> (or &ldquo;MQ&rdquo;), a quadrangle with a number of museums.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Modern art museum – &#8220;mumok&#8221;</div>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t have time to stop in any of them. Next time, I promise. We wandered past the Natural History Museum to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofburg_Palace">Hofburg Palace</a>, the winter residence of the Hapsburgs and the current residence of the President of Austria.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/aus/palace.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Hofburg Palace</div>
</div>


<p>We then walked past the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathaus,_Vienna">Rathaus</a>, a beautiful gothic building. After that, we went through the windy streets of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innere_Stadt">first district</a> where there were lots of expensive shops and embassies.</p>

<p>We ended up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephansplatz,_Vienna">Stephansplatz</a>, containing the impressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephansdom">Stephansdom</a>. The roof in particular, a mosaic of coloured tiles, was spectacular.</p>

If you&rsquo;re short on time and need a whistle-stop tour, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. However, we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to really take in everything. We would both love to come back to Vienna and maybe even go in some of the wonderful buildings we passed.</p>

<p>Plus, there seem to be a number of great bars and restaurants which we couldn&rsquo;t make it to. We&rsquo;ll be back soon!</p>

    <updated>2014-05-13T10:10:18+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/13/linz</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had never been to Austria before, so I was excited for my first visit. I wondered how much like Germany and Switzerland it would be.</p>

<p>We were attending <a href="codefront.io">Codefront.io</a>, so took an early flight from Paris to Vienna, then a coach to Linz. After a quick nap in our hotel (which was near the conference venue, and a little tricky to get to the centre from), we headed to the old centre of Linz. As it was Friday evening, there were brass bands and beer stands everywhere. It was quaint, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Although after living in the US for a while, it was strange seeing people drinking on the street.</p>

<p>We made a bee-line for the <a href="http://www.yelp.at/biz/cocktailbar-easy-linz">best-rated cocktail bar on Yelp</a>: <a href="http://www.cocktailbareasy.at/">Cocktailbar Easy</a> (yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure about the name either).</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/aus/easybar.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Gimlet and Manhattan</div>
</div>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a thing about cocktails in Europe (as far as Hampton and I can tell). They tend to be sweeter and less alcoholic than those you get in the US. Cocktails here tend to have a lot of fruit juice, and remind me more of something you&rsquo;d get on a cruise ship in the US – piña coladas and daiquiris, for example. If you order a Manhattan, be prepared for a lot of vermouth with a bit of bourbon, served over ice.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s why we were excited about Cocktailbar Easy. They served US-style cocktails. As far as we could tell, though, we were the only people drinking them. Everyone else had drinks in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_glass">hurricane glasses</a> with a neon-red cherry and a slice of pineapple on top.</p>

<p>The drinks were pretty good, but there was one jarring aspect – which turned out to be true across the Austrian bars we visited. People smoke indoors while they drink. And I&rsquo;m not talking one or two people in a room of 50-or-so. In Cocktailbar Easy, I&rsquo;m pretty sure 50% of the crowd were smoking.</p>

<p>As the seating was mainly at the bar, we had groups sitting either side of us. They would hold their cigarettes away from their friends – right in our direction. It was pretty overwhelming and soon I couldn&rsquo;t really taste the cocktails we had. We are (somewhat) used to dive bars allowing smoking indoors, but at a fancy cocktail place it seems strange. Wouldn&rsquo;t they want to emphasise their nice-tasting drinks?</p>

<p>A nice bit about the bar: as you come out of the smokey room into the fresh air, you&rsquo;re right in front of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Cathedral,_Linz">Linz Neuerdom</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>The next day we attended the conference, which was at Johannes Kepler University. We had to grab a quick bite to eat, and found a kiosk just <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Altenbergerstra%C3%9Fe+49/@48.3352722,14.3200481,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47739842e4c97287:0x985fb68ad982b98a">outside the Universität stop</a>. It had pretty cheap schnitzel, so we thought we&rsquo;d give it a go.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/aus/kiosk.jpg">
  <div class="alt">The kiosk (yes, it served wine)</div>
</div>


<p>It looked super-sketchy and we weren&rsquo;t quite sure what to make of it. You ordered at the window, then you stood at a ledge and ate. Hampton ordered schnitzel. We expected the guy to reach down into a freezer and throw some partially-thawed thing into a deep-fat fryer. However, he got out a fresh chicken breast, beat it with a mallet, put it in an egg-bath, etc. It was the tastiest schnitzel we had while in Austria.</p>

</div>


<p>It was a little strange standing up to eat, but the food was totally worth it.</p>

<p>After watching Eurovision (go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRUIava4WRM">Conchita</a>!), the next day we took a train to Vienna. That&rsquo;ll be in the next post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a quick trip to Jacksonville for my father-in-law&rsquo;s birthday, our next stop was Philadelphia. I had only visited Philadelphia by passing through its airport, and I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it as a city, so I was excited to spend a few days there. I was on my best behaviour and only made one joke about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia">it being sunny</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>Our first night we went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ranstead-room-philadelphia">the Ranstead Room</a>, at 20th and Ranstead. It&rsquo;s down an alley behind a modest black door.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Door to Ranstead Room</div>
</div>


<p>The cocktails were classics done well – try one of the fizzes if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start. The bartender was great at asking what you like and making something up. I got a Chartreuse and egg white drink (called the, uh, &ldquo;Chika Chika Boom Boom&rdquo;) that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>They serve food from the pared-down menu of their sister restaurant, El Rey. They had great tacos, plus some amazing popcorn with Jamaican spice that was both citrusy and umami.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Our delightful host</a> took us on a tour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City,_Philadelphia">Old City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_Hill,_Philadelphia">Society Hill</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_(Philadelphia)">South Street</a>. Old City and Society Hill have quaint colonial houses with a lot of history. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been living in San Francisco too long, but I was impressed with all the pre-1800 buildings.</p>

<p>We stopped in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jinxed-tuckers-digs-philadelphia">a neat store</a> that seemed to sell a lot of odd items (including lamps made out of what looked like spinal columns). On the way out, I looked down a small alley – <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@39.941169,-75.148958,3a,75y,102.7h,81.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sQadqWDkEoiNfRxrUPPZrGA!2e0">Kater St</a> – to see some incredible mosaic-murals.</p>

<p>The mosaics are the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Zagar">Isaiah Zagar</a>, who has around 200 mosaics in the South Street area of Philadelphia. They use a lot of mirror pieces and include quotations and the address of the place. They were mesmerising and I felt I could have spent hours sitting in front of them. Apparently there&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dream_(film)">a movie about him</a>, so I&rsquo;ll have to check that out.</p>

</div>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend more time in the South Street area of Philadelphia to find more of these murals.</p>

<h3>An aside:</h3>

<p>The amount of history in Philadelphia, especially regarding the founding of the United States and the beginning of the revolutionary war, was a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not ignorant of the history between the UK and the USA. Being British in the USA leads to good-natured ribbing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)">being a redcoat</a>. However, wandering around the centre of where the USA was founded and independence was sought is different. Everywhere there&rsquo;s information about how the revolutionaries were throwing off their repressive chains and seeking liberty. Implicit in all of the historical placards and explanatory signage was that they wanted to get away from the baddies. And in this case, the baddies were my ancestors (well, kinda).</p>

<p>I felt defensive, like I needed to stand up for my country: the UK wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad, was it? I&rsquo;m not a patriotic person, so feeling protective about my homeland was novel. I also felt conspicuous – that some tell would give me away, and people would be mad that the enemy was desecrating their site,  even though I was just standing there. I was sure I was only a moment away from being kicked out of the Constitution Museum or something.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really lived in another country, so I assume this is a pretty standard foreigner&rsquo;s paranoia. Maybe I should start wearing one of those sweet <a href="http://www.animalshirts.net/americanflagshirts/eaglefly.jpg">stars-and-stripes, eagle-soaring shirts</a> to blend in more.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/25/the-columbia-room</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was glad our friend had already been to <a href="http://columbiaroomdc.com/">The Columbia Room</a> and met us outside, otherwise I don&rsquo;t think we would have been able to find it. It&rsquo;s hidden in the back of an upscale dive bar called The Passenger on 7th St in D.C. Inside, it&rsquo;s tiny (I think there were ten seats) and sparsely-decorated (some apothecary-style bottles with herbs were behind the bar). The service, level of expertise from the bartenders, and the inventiveness of flavour pairings reminded me of the few Michelin-starred restaurants I&rsquo;ve been to. Except with liquor instead of food.</p>

<p>The set menu consists of three drinks and a couple of snacks, coming in at around $65 per person. Pricey, but definitely worth it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>After being offered cold towels scented with cucumber (!), we started out with a rum and lemon-based punch served in a teacup. It tasted pretty much like iced tea – but, y&#8217;know, alcoholic. So better than regular iced tea.</p>

<p>The second drink, the Getaway, had two main ingredients: a black rum and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynar">cynar</a> (<em>chee</em>-nar).</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/getaway-ingredients.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Ingredients for the Getaway</div>
</div>


<p>Cynar is a dark brown artichoke-based liqueur. It has a number of other spices in it, so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re drinking artichoke juice or anything. Mixed with the dark rum, some salted bitters and a bit of lemon, and wow. With each sip you went through four or five different flavour profiles – acidity of the lemon, saltiness, herbs, molasses. It was extremely drinkable and all three of us had to pace ourselves so we didn&rsquo;t finish it in two gulps.</p>

<p>The Getaway was served with an artichoke (to pair with the cynar) and green olive tapenade-type thing. It was pretty tasty, but I wish there had been more of it. Or maybe I should have eaten more for dinner.</p>

<p>For last cocktail of the set, we had a choice. Either a cynar and grapefruit/blood orange soda <strong>or</strong> a cynar and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit">akvavit</a> combination. Two of us plumped for the cynar/aquavit drink – it tasted a lot like a negroni. The soda drink was refreshing and a nice end to the tasting.</p>

<p>As the previous cocktails were so good, we decided to stay for another one each. We asked the bartender for two gin-based drinks – one with citrus and one without.</p>

<p>Hampton got a dry martini with Plymouth gin. It was pretty delicious. The bartender recommended Plymouth as a good go-to gin that mixes well with other ingredients.</p>

  <div class="alt">Last Word Ingredients</div>
</div>


<p>I received a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Word_(cocktail)">Last Word</a> – Tanqueray 10 gin, Luxardo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino">maraschino liqueur</a>, lime juice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)">Chartreuse</a>. I had been drinking Chartreuse the previous Saturday, both neat and in a Chartreuse gimlet. I liked it a lot, so I was pretty excited it came up in the cocktail the bartender made for me here.</p>

<p>The Maraschino liqueur was strange. I&rsquo;m familiar with Luxardo-style maraschino cherries, so was expecting the liqueuer to be a deep purple syrup. However, it looked and tasted more like a simple syrup that had a hint of cherry flavour.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>Mixing all of them together was amazing. The freshness of the limes worked well with the herbal qualities of the gin and the Chartreuse. The Maraschino added a touch of sweetness to round it all out. Apparently, the bartender likes to put a little more gin compared to normal Last Word-style drinks, which is what he said gives his the edge over the competition.</p>

<p>I highly recommend visiting this place if you&rsquo;re in the D.C. area. We managed to make reservations a couple of weeks in advance for a Wednesday night. I hear the building is being taken over soon – although I assume they will be moving to a new location.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/22/carry-on-packing-for-seven-months/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-22T18:09:09+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/22/carry-on-packing-for-seven-months</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">good friend</a> converted us to <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=7432">always packing carry-ons</a> when going on trips. It&rsquo;s far easier to travel with a carry-on – especially when taking low-cost airlines that charge to check luggage.</p>

<p>The longest we have spent living out of a carry-on has been about three months. The benefits definitely outweighed the negatives. If we ran out of clothes, we could often find laundry facilities. Anything we forgot could usually be bought locally. So, for this trip we took the plunge and aimed to pack only a carry-on for seven months of travel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to pack for seven months in a carry-on when you&rsquo;re travelling during summer. No hats, scarves, gloves, or bulky coats are necessary. Of course, when we make it back to the East Coast it will be autumn and may be a little chilly. At that point, we can easily buy warmer clothes (as <a href="https://twitter.com/hcatlin/status/458307183470342144">Hampton pointed out</a>, clothes tend to be more expensive in Europe).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Choosing things to pack was pretty simple. I went through T-shirts I liked and grabbed them. One pair of darker jeans (that could work in a nicer restaurant) is useful. Shirts that look good without needing to be ironed are helpful if you need a dressier option and don&rsquo;t have an iron handy.</p>

<p>I also made sure to pack some older clothes, too, so I could throw things out if necessary.</p>

<p>Getting it into the suitcase was simple by rolling everything up. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/06/business/businessspecial/20100506-pack-ss.html?_r=0">the &ldquo;roll&rdquo; style of packing</a>, it&rsquo;s excellent and allows you to fit a lot more in a suitcase (and keep things mostly wrinkle-free).</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/side-one.JPG">
  <div class="alt">First side</div>
</div>




<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/side-two.JPG">
  <div class="alt">Second side</div>
</div>


<p>The two images above contain about two weeks&#8217; worth of clothes. Making sure I wear bulky items when travelling means that the lighter versions (e.g. a lighter jacket, thinner shoes) fit in the suitcase. The contact lenses should be <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/medically-necessary-liquids">allowed as medical liquids</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 polo shirt</li>
<li>3 shirts</li>
<li>11 regular socks</li>
<li>7 ankle socks</li>
<li>16 pairs of underwear</li>
<li>2 pairs of trousers</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts</li>
<li>1 pair of swimming trunks</li>
<li>2 pairs of shoes (one boot-like, one light and foldable)</li>
<li>2 jackets (one light, one heavy)</li>
<li>1 toothbrush</li>
<li>1 razor</li>
<li>1 pair of sunglasses</li>
<li>90 pairs of contact lenses</li>
<li>1 international adaptor</li>
</ul>


<p>Our laptop bags will have toiletries (shaving cream, toothpaste and deodorant only – everything else we can buy as we need it), our laptops, kindles, and chargers.</p>

<p>And there you go. That&rsquo;s how you pack for seven months in only carry-on.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Zeltserman">Zeltserman, Dave</a> &ndash; The Caretaker of Lorne Field &ndash; 7.3</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things worth mentioning about these last few letters of the alphabet. X and Z were surprisingly good considering they were &ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; letters.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help comparing Revolutionary Road with Rabbit, Run. They had broadly similar themes, in my head. Unhappy couples in the 1950s/60s who live dull lives. I thought Revolutionary Road did this far, far better. I understood the characters. Updike seemed to write off Rabbit&rsquo;s wife as unexplainable &ndash; she was incredibly two-dimensional. Compared with April Wheeler, which was a very sympathetic portrait of a woman trapped in a life she didn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll do a longer wrap-up post this weekend on LIFE-LESSONS and such.</p>

<p>Two things. First, I really didn&rsquo;t understand Rabbit, Run and I need to find someone who&rsquo;s read that (and preferably the other ones in the series) to discuss it with.</p>

<p>Second, I&rsquo;m almost there! Just four more letters left. I think I&rsquo;ll make it before 2014 starts. I must admit, this challenge wasn&rsquo;t as satisfying as War and Peace. It&rsquo;s been good to get to some new authors, but I&rsquo;ve found myself wanting to stray too much. At least with War and Peace I could still read other books.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://localeditionsf.com/">Local Edition</a> on Market at 3rd, there&rsquo;s a nice bourbon-based cocktail called the Brass Check. I think it&rsquo;s my favourite on their menu. The grapefruit comes through, but the syrup softens it so it&rsquo;s not too sour. The Rosebud is pretty good, too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Buffalo Trace Bourbon</li>
<li>Cyanar</li>
<li>Grapefruit</li>
<li>Lemon</li>
<li>Maple syrup</li>
<li>Strawberry</li>

    <updated>2013-06-29T19:55:01+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/06/29/cocktail-breakfast-of-champions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you eat at a fancy restaurant (or at least a restaurant with a world-renowned chef), you have to get the weirdest thing on the menu. That chef (or restaurant) is famous for a reason &ndash; it creates flavour profiles that are going to be pleasing. So why waste your time on something standard?</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/cocktails/breakfast-of-champions.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Breakfast of Champions</div>
</div>


<p>That philosophy was how I ended up getting the Breakfast of Champions cocktail, pictured above, at <a href="http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/">ad hoc</a> the other weekend. Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>St George Botanivore gin</li>
<li>Fruit Loop-infused milk</li>
<li>Egg white</li>
</ul>


<p>It was so. bloody. delicious. In fact, I called the bartender over to congratulate him. The cocktail had only been on the menu for about a week, and he seemed chuffed with my praise. He even brought over some of the milk for us to try.</p>

<p>The cocktail itself was a more floral/fruity version of a standard sour drink. It wasn&rsquo;t too heavy and didn&rsquo;t have that gross milk aftertaste. It was seriously good. I must figure out how to make it at home.</p>

<p>Seriously, at nice restaurants always try something you think sounds gross.</p>

</ul>


<p>As I&rsquo;m just over half-way through the alphabet, I&rsquo;m going to do a top five books so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I, Claudius &ndash; Graves</li>
<li>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius &ndash; Eggers</li>
<li>Dubliners &ndash; Joyce</li>
<li>Under the Skin &ndash; Faber</li>
<li>In Cold Blood &ndash; Capote</li>
</ol>


<p>° I couldn&rsquo;t even finish it. I made it to the half-way point, then had to stop. The book is supposed to be (partly) a take on Joyce, but I found the obfuscated narrative unreadable. Maybe this is what Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake is like?</p>
