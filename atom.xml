    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">good friend</a> converted us to <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=7432">always packing carry-ons</a> when going on trips. It&rsquo;s far easier to travel with a carry-on – especially when taking low-cost airlines that charge to check luggage.</p>

<p>The longest we have spent living out of a carry-on has been about three months. The benefits definitely outweighed the negatives. If we ran out of clothes, we could often find laundry facilities. Anything we forgot could usually be bought locally. So, for this trip we took the plunge and aimed to pack only a carry-on for seven months of travel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to pack for seven months in a carry-on when you&rsquo;re travelling during summer. No hats, scarves, gloves, or bulky coats are necessary. Of course, when we make it back to the East Coast it will be autumn and may be a little chilly. At that point, we can easily buy warmer clothes (as <a href="https://twitter.com/hcatlin/status/458307183470342144">Hampton pointed out</a>, clothes tend to be more expensive in Europe).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Choosing things to pack was pretty simple. I went through T-shirts I liked and grabbed them. One pair of darker jeans (that could work in a nicer restaurant) is useful. Shirts that look good without needing to be ironed are helpful if you need a dressier option and don&rsquo;t have an iron handy.</p>

<p>I also made sure to pack some older clothes, too, so I could throw things out if necessary.</p>

<p>Getting it into the suitcase was simple by rolling everything up. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/06/business/businessspecial/20100506-pack-ss.html?_r=0">the &ldquo;roll&rdquo; style of packing</a>, it&rsquo;s excellent and allows you to fit a lot more in a suitcase (and keep things mostly wrinkle-free).</p>

  <div class="alt">Second side</div>
</div>


<p>The two images above contain about two weeks&#8217; worth of clothes.Making sure I wear bulky items when travelling means that the lighter versions (e.g. a lighter jacket, thinner shoes) fit in the suitcase. The contact lenses should be <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/medically-necessary-liquids">allowed as medical liquids</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 polo shirt</li>
<li>3 shirts</li>
<li>11 regular socks</li>
<li>7 ankle socks</li>
<li>16 pairs of underwear</li>
<li>2 pairs of trousers</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts</li>
<li>1 pair of swimming trunks</li>
<li>2 pairs of shoes (one boot-like, one light and foldable)</li>
<li>2 jackets (one light, one heavy)</li>
<li>1 toothbrush</li>
<li>1 razor</li>
<li>1 pair of sunglasses</li>
<li>90 pairs of contact lenses</li>
<li>1 international adaptor</li>
</ul>


<p>Our laptop bags will have toiletries (shaving cream, toothpaste and deodorant only – everything else we can buy as we need it), our laptops, kindles, and chargers.</p>

<p>And there you go. That&rsquo;s how you pack for seven months in only carry-on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the next seven months, Hampton and I will be travelling around Europe and the East Coast. We have few solid plans aside from some conferences (<a href="http://codefront.io/">Codefront.io</a>, <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">La Conf</a>, <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a> and <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a>).</p>

<p>A friend gave me the idea to blog as we travel. I&rsquo;ve been lax with this blog recently, and I hope that switching platforms (from WordPress to Octopress) will spur me to write more.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Zeltserman">Zeltserman, Dave</a> &ndash; The Caretaker of Lorne Field &ndash; 7.3</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things worth mentioning about these last few letters of the alphabet. X and Z were surprisingly good considering they were &ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; letters.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help comparing Revolutionary Road with Rabbit, Run. They had broadly similar themes, in my head. Unhappy couples in the 1950s/60s who live dull lives. I thought Revolutionary Road did this far, far better. I understood the characters. Updike seemed to write off Rabbit&rsquo;s wife as unexplainable &ndash; she was incredibly two-dimensional. Compared with April Wheeler, which was a very sympathetic portrait of a woman trapped in a life she didn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll do a longer wrap-up post this weekend on LIFE-LESSONS and such.</p>

<p>Two things. First, I really didn&rsquo;t understand Rabbit, Run and I need to find someone who&rsquo;s read that (and preferably the other ones in the series) to discuss it with.</p>

<p>Second, I&rsquo;m almost there! Just four more letters left. I think I&rsquo;ll make it before 2014 starts. I must admit, this challenge wasn&rsquo;t as satisfying as War and Peace. It&rsquo;s been good to get to some new authors, but I&rsquo;ve found myself wanting to stray too much. At least with War and Peace I could still read other books.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://localeditionsf.com/">Local Edition</a> on Market at 3rd, there&rsquo;s a nice bourbon-based cocktail called the Brass Check. I think it&rsquo;s my favourite on their menu. The grapefruit comes through, but the syrup softens it so it&rsquo;s not too sour. The Rosebud is pretty good, too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Buffalo Trace Bourbon</li>
<li>Cyanar</li>
<li>Grapefruit</li>
<li>Lemon</li>
<li>Maple syrup</li>
<li>Strawberry</li>

    <updated>2013-06-29T14:55:01-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/06/29/cocktail-breakfast-of-champions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you eat at a fancy restaurant (or at least a restaurant with a world-renowned chef), you have to get the weirdest thing on the menu. That chef (or restaurant) is famous for a reason &ndash; it creates flavour profiles that are going to be pleasing. So why waste your time on something standard?</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/cocktails/breakfast-of-champions.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Breakfast of Champions</div>
</div>


<p>That philosophy was how I ended up getting the Breakfast of Champions cocktail, pictured above, at <a href="http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/">ad hoc</a> the other weekend. Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>St George Botanivore gin</li>
<li>Fruit Loop-infused milk</li>
<li>Egg white</li>
</ul>


<p>It was so. bloody. delicious. In fact, I called the bartender over to congratulate him. The cocktail had only been on the menu for about a week, and he seemed chuffed with my praise. He even brought over some of the milk for us to try.</p>

<p>The cocktail itself was a more floral/fruity version of a standard sour drink. It wasn&rsquo;t too heavy and didn&rsquo;t have that gross milk aftertaste. It was seriously good. I must figure out how to make it at home.</p>

<p>Seriously, at nice restaurants always try something you think sounds gross.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/06/23/m-n-o</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>

</ul>


<p>As I&rsquo;m just over half-way through the alphabet, I&rsquo;m going to do a top five books so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I, Claudius &ndash; Graves</li>
<li>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius &ndash; Eggers</li>
<li>Dubliners &ndash; Joyce</li>
<li>Under the Skin &ndash; Faber</li>
<li>In Cold Blood &ndash; Capote</li>
</ol>


<p>° I couldn&rsquo;t even finish it. I made it to the half-way point, then had to stop. The book is supposed to be (partly) a take on Joyce, but I found the obfuscated narrative unreadable. Maybe this is what Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake is like?</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/04/04/d-e-f</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on from my previous post, the next three novels I read were by authors with surnames beginning with D, E, and F:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._L._Doctorow">E.L. Doctorow</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Daniel_(novel)">The Book of Daniel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers">Dave Eggers</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius">A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Faber">Michel Faber</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(novel)">Under the Skin</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I totally didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; The Book of Daniel. It was semi-interesting from a historical perspective &ndash; in the US stories are very rarely told from a communist viewpoint. The style was too disjointed for me to enjoy the book (I&rsquo;m usually OK with that but&hellip; not here, for some reason). So yeah, not my favourite so far.</p>

<p>AHWoSG was staggering (shut up, I had to). I loved it. Being a recent (ok, recent-ish) SF transplant, I love anything that involves the Bay Area (I <em>really</em> wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Widow">Red Widow</a> to be good and I&rsquo;m stupidly excited about <a href="http://sfist.com/2013/03/28/new_hbo_pilot_about_gay_thirtysomet.php">a pilot for some HBO show they&rsquo;re currently filming</a>).</p>

<p>But even aside from the SF-love, it was a moving account of an unusual relationship between two brothers. I&rsquo;m 93% sure I&rsquo;m the last person to have read this book, though, so everyone knows how awesome it is already. Oh, and bonus points because I&rsquo;m now watching reruns of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_World:_San_Francisco">The Real World San Francisco</a> and a couple of the characters appear in the novel.</p>

<p>I also really dug Under the Skin, despite its vegetarian preachiness. I&rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for sci-fi that&rsquo;s less about the sci and more about the fi. The central character was a pretty fascinating one. They&rsquo;re apparently making a film of it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>. I&rsquo;m puzzling on how they&rsquo;re going to treat some of the more gruesome aspects of the book.</p>

<p>The next trio of GHI are pretty long, so it might be a while before another update.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/03/03/a-b-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace">War and Peace</a> &ndash; it has 365 chapters, so fit neatly into one year at a chapter a day. It was nice having a challenge to finish such an epic book and gave me a reason to read every day.</p>

<p>I needed to come up with a challenge for 2013 (although it&rsquo;ll probably spill into 2014). After writing down a list of books I wanted to read, I noticed that there was a string of authors with surnames starting with consecutive letters of the alphabet. I started expanding the list to fit other letters. The only rule is that I can&rsquo;t have read the author before.</p>

<p>So, this is the start of the A-Z Book Challenge. My first three books were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(novel)">Money</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Amis">Martin Amis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths">Labyrinths</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote">Truman Capote</a>.</p>

<p>My favourite was probably Money. It was interesting and fun to read an author who has been influential to other authors I&rsquo;ve read in ways I didn&rsquo;t realise. The central character, John Self, was one of the strongest and most fascinating narrators I&rsquo;ve read in a while.</p>

<p>Labyrinths took me a while to get into. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of the ideas presented in other ways (e.g. science fiction movies), but some of the stories resonated. In particular, I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_the_Sword">The Form of the Sword</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">The Garden of Forking Paths</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote">Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</a>. The last one in particular stuck with me, for some reason &ndash; maybe its relevance to copyright, plagiarism, etc. and the internet?</p>

<p>In Cold Blood was great. I went through it surprisingly fast &ndash; it was an easy read. I understand it&rsquo;s probably more fiction than fact, but Perry Smith was a seriously likeable character(/person?).</p>

<p>Anyway, next up: The Book of Daniel by E. L. Doctorow.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-05T14:10:32-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/01/05/midsummer-house</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We were in the UK for Christmas, and my parents told us to keep one evening free from seeing our friends &ndash; they had a plan. They didn&rsquo;t tell us what it was &ndash; not even on the cab ride there. We were equally intrigued (what could it be? It had to be dinner, right?) and anxious (what if we didn&rsquo;t like it?).</p>

<p>As we entered the backroads of northern Cambridge, we realised we were going to <a href="http://www.midsummerhouse.co.uk/">Midsummer House</a>, the 2-Michelin-starred restaurant where we got married just over three years ago. Needless to say, we were both incredibly excited. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was incredible. I think it supersedes other meals I&rsquo;ve had there to be the best meal of my life. I took some pictures, so here you go:</p>

<p>I missed two courses: a broccoli, pear and blue cheese starter and an apple crumble thing with baked yoghurt. Both were intense and I must have dove in without thinking to take a picture.</p>

<p>The meal took four hours and I loved every minute of it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2012/02/25/the-artist/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-25T14:21:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2012/02/25/the-artist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it&rsquo;s the Oscars tomorrow, we decided to watch The Artist. I think it&rsquo;s still the frontrunner for the major awards, so it seems appropriate. And this year I&rsquo;m really excited, as it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ll be able to watch the Academy Awards LIVE! (I&rsquo;m a dork, I know.)</p>

<p>It was pretty awesome, I must say. At first the lack of dialogue was (weirdly enough) distracting, but I soon got into it. The two leads are adorable, as is the dog. I want to own that dog. The music was great (I guess you have to have pretty awesome music if you&rsquo;re going to make a silent film&hellip;).</p>

<p>There was one thing I found annoying, and it&rsquo;s a bit of a spoiler, so&hellip; <strong>spoiler warning</strong>! It was the very end. Firstly, I thought leaving it at &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; would have been a cleaner finish. Secondly, hearing Dujardin say &ldquo;with pleasure!&rdquo; in his super-French accent was weird. I was watching the film not imagining him to be French and&hellip; I dunno, for me it broke the illusion. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that he&rsquo;s French. It was just jarring. OK, <strong>spoilers over</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great choice for Best Picture tomorrow. It&rsquo;s got the nostalgia, the appreciation for film as an art-form, and a crowd-pleasing storyline.</p>

<p>In fact, it makes me happy I enjoyed it so much. When the nominees for this year&rsquo;s Oscars were announced, I was seriously disappointed. One measly mention each for Drive (Best Sound Editing) and The Ides of March (Best Adapted Screenplay). No major awards for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (bar the Best Actress nod). Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve only seen three of the Best Picture nominees (Hugo, Moneyball and now The Artist) &ndash; but two of them I didn&rsquo;t like. So liking The Artist at least gives me a film to root for. (I&rsquo;d still like Gary Oldman to win for Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, though.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;ll probably post something after the awards tomorrow, with my disdain for the winners&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first post on SF was a bit tourist-y. This one will be more focused on food and drink. And other funstuff.</p>

<p>We ate at a neat burger place on Union Sq &ndash; the aptly-named <a href="http://www.burger-bar.com/">Burger Bar</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">The burger I had. I think it was buffalo?</div>
</div>


<p>The milkshakes (picture missing) were amazing. The nutella one was just ice-cream and nutella, pretty much. The burger was good&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve had better (I&rsquo;m looking at you, The Bird in Berlin.)</p>

<p>We went to an awesome beach &ndash; China Beach. It was really quiet and had insane views of the Golden Gate and its bridge.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/san-francisco/china-beach.jpg">
</div>


<p>Oh, and something else I&rsquo;d highly recommend is Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It&rsquo;s on every Thursday and has a general theme every week (we went for 80s nostalgia/comedy). They have booze, you can wander around the exhibits, and they play pretty awesome music.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all I have to say. If you keep track of my whereabouts, you&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve now moved to San Francisco to live. It&rsquo;s awesome here!</p>

<p>We flew United 2623 from CLT to SFO. They had WIFI!!!!! Zomg. It&rsquo;s still a novelty for me. I don&rsquo;t have many photos of the CLT-SFO flight, just the food pretty much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been to San Francisco before, so it was a bit of an adventure. We only spent a couple of days doing touristy things, and the rest of the time was mostly Hampton working at Moovweb and me working on the book. Here&rsquo;s some tourist photos.</p>

<p>One of the best views for the whole two weeks was from the GrandViews lounge in the Grand Hyatt. The cocktails were OK, the food in the neighbouring restaurant the same, but the views&hellip; wow. This was at sunset. You can see the TransAm building and Coit Tower from this angle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So&hellip; I really need to start blogging about an amazing trip I&rsquo;ve been on. It&rsquo;s been going for about two months now. It started in July, when we moved out of our apartment in Cambridge, England.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2011/07/18/a-few-hours-in-london/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-18T15:39:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2011/07/18/a-few-hours-in-london</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, we went to London to see some of our best friends. We only really had an afternoon and evening. We started by heading to South Kensington and wandering around the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">V&amp;A</a> for a bit. I love the V&amp;A. It&rsquo;s got enough variety to keep things interesting. We visited rooms on architecture,  Islamic history and British design in the late Victorian era in the space of a couple of hours. Awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, we went to a pub, then to sushi at <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/52/565671/restaurant/London/Kulu-Kulu-Sushi-South-Kensington">Kulu Kulu</a>, a conveyor belt place. Lots of delicious food&hellip; but weirdly lacking on the fish. Still, I&rsquo;m not complaining. Their stewed aubergine thing with soy sauce was amazing. Nom!</p>

<p>One of our friends had heard about an absinthe bar nearby. In fact, it was underneath a restaurant (the <a href="http://www.bromptonbarandgrill.com/">Brompton Bar &amp; Grill</a>). I&rsquo;ve never had absinthe before. Although it&rsquo;d been banned in the USA and France, it was always legal in the UK. I guess no one liked it enough for it to present much of a &ldquo;danger&rdquo; to society. Now the green fairy is being legalised in many countries, drinking absinthe is finding a resurgence.</p>

<p>We decided to skip cocktails with absinthe and go straight to the pure stuff. There was a great theatricality to the process. A water cooler (in 19th century French style, of course) was put on the table with four miniature taps.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/london/absinthe.jpg">
</div>


<p>This was filled with ice-cold water. (Sorry the pictures are so dark. It was underground and mainly lit by candles.)</p>

<p>We got a small glass with some absinthe in. Balanced on top was a special spoon (shaped like a leaf) with holes in it. A brown sugar cube was placed on top. You put the sugar cube underneath the tap and slowly let the water drip onto the cube. The sugar dissolves and drips down into the absinthe, diluting and sweetening it.</p>

<p>Once all that&rsquo;s done, you can drink away. It wasn&rsquo;t as liquorice-y as I thought it might be. Which is good, because I hate liquorice. It was certainly an enjoyable experience, even if I didn&rsquo;t hallucinate.</p>

<p>After that, we made a trek to the north-east of London to the <a href="http://www.whistlingshop.com/">Worship Street Whistling Shop</a>. It&rsquo;s a Victorian-themed bar, with many gin-based drinks. It was too dark to take decent photos inside &ndash; but there were lots of barrels and canvas-covered stools. The waiters were dressed in something akin to what barbers wear.</p>

<p>Anyway, the drinks here were <strong>a-mazing</strong>. Pricey, but still. I got the &ldquo;Panacea&rdquo; (Compass Box Whisky, honey and lavender shrub, lemon juice and sage dust) the first time around, then the Civility Cocktail (Lillet Blanc, Martini Extra Dry, WS2 Exhaustion Tonic and WS2 raspberry syrup). They were super-tasty. I&rsquo;d highly recommend this place. Apparently, this is the second bar this company has opened &ndash; so I desperately want to visit their first, a speakeasy near Marylebone called <a href="http://www.purl-london.com/">Purl</a>.</p>

    <updated>2011-06-30T15:46:56-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2011/06/30/lyon-part-deux-la-cuisine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise that Lyon was the centre for French gastronomy. But apparently it is. Anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d devote a whole post to the food I ate there, in addition to my first post on the city itself.</p>

<p>The first night, we ate at <a href="http://www.brasseriegeorges.com/">Brasserie Georges</a>. It&rsquo;s apparently pretty famous (it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasserie_Georges">Wikipedia article</a> &ndash; a sure sign of prominence). They served some traditional Lyon food &ndash; including a pistachio sausage thing, which was pretty nice. Also on the list of traditional Lyon foods were a mustard sausage and calf&rsquo;s head. I think I made the right choice with a pistachio sausage.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/lyon/georges.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    I forgot to take pictures of the food.
  </div>
</div>


<p>The second evening, we went to a place called <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1256&amp;bih=738&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Les+enfants+terribles+lyon&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=Les+enfants+terribles&amp;hnear=0x47f4ea516ae88797:0x408ab2ae4bb21f0,Lyon,+France&amp;cid=9879979365541420669">Les Enfants Terribles</a>&hellip; it was OK. Nothing too special. The duck salad I had to start had too much mustard dressing on it. The main was beef, coupled with some deeeeelicious dauphinoise potatoes. I think they must have used chicken stock or something. The dessert was pretty good&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not much of a surprise as I love all tartes au citron. The filling had a strange granular texture &ndash; I think they might have added ground almonds or something.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/lyon/duck-salad.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Starter: duck salad with some foie gras.
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="alt">
    Main: beef with dauphinoise potatoes.

  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/lyon/tarte-citron.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Dessert: tarte au citron.
  </div>
</div>


<p>For Sunday lunch, we went to a pretty decent restaurant near the hotel (in the Brotteaux area) &ndash; it was called <a href="http://www.nordsudbrasseries.com/">Brasserie de l&#8217;Est</a>. It seems to be part of a chain. The food was pretty good! I&rsquo;d recommend it. I forgot to take pictures, though.</p>

<p>On our final night, we ended up at <a href="http://www.hippopotamus.fr/">Hippopotamus</a>. I&rsquo;ve seen a few in Paris. They&rsquo;re some kind of chain that serves vaguely French food &ndash; steaks, etc. It was, as we kinda expected, mediocre. I had an assortment of fried goods. It was very American.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/lyon/hippo.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    The fried stuff from Hippopotamus.
  </div>
</div>


<p>One of the better meals I had was (strangely?) at the airport. It was the airport branch of the 2-Michelin-starred <a href="http://www.nicolaslebec.com/">Nicolas Le Bec</a>, which is in the centre of Lyon. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.espace-lebec.com/">Espace Le Bec</a>. We both had a really delicious penne with bolognese. It had the most amazing cheese sliced over it, too. SO GOOD.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">
    Penne with bolognese.
  </div>
</div>


<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much all the food I ate in Lyon. I wasn&rsquo;t there that long, so I can&rsquo;t really confirm or deny its status as le centre gastronomique of France. I&rsquo;ve had better meals in Paris. (But Espace Le Bec was definitely the best meal I&rsquo;ve had at an airport.)</p>
