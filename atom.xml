    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a quick trip to Jacksonville for my father-in-law&rsquo;s birthday, our next stop was Philadelphia. I had only visited Philadelphia by passing through its airport, and I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it as a city, so I was excited to spend a few days there. I was on my best behaviour and only made one joke about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia">it being sunny</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>Our first night we went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ranstead-room-philadelphia">the Ranstead Room</a>, at 20th and Ranstead. It&rsquo;s down an alley behind a modest black door.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>The cocktails were classics done well – try one of the fizzes if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start. The bartender was great at asking what you like and making something up. I got a Chartreuse and egg white drink (called the, uh, &ldquo;Chika Chika Boom Boom&rdquo;) that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>They serve food from the pared-down menu of their sister restaurant, El Rey. They had great tacos, plus some amazing popcorn with Jamaican spice that was both citrusy and umami.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Our delightful host</a> took us on a tour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City,_Philadelphia">Old City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_Hill,_Philadelphia">Society Hill</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_(Philadelphia)">South Street</a>. Old City and Society Hill have quaint colonial houses with a lot of history. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been living in San Francisco too long, but I was impressed with all the pre-1800 buildings.</p>

<p>We stopped in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jinxed-tuckers-digs-philadelphia">a neat store</a> that seemed to sell a lot of odd items (including lamps made out of what looked like spinal columns). On the way out, I looked down a small alley – <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@39.941169,-75.148958,3a,75y,102.7h,81.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sQadqWDkEoiNfRxrUPPZrGA!2e0">Kater St</a> – to see some incredible mosaic-murals.</p>

<p>The mosaics are the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Zagar">Isaiah Zagar</a>, who has around 200 mosaics in the South Street area of Philadelphia. They use a lot of mirror pieces and include quotations and the address of the place. They were mesmerising and I felt I could have spent hours sitting in front of them. Apparently there&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dream_(film)">a movie about him</a>, so I&rsquo;ll have to check that out.</p>

</div>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend more time in the South Street area of Philadelphia to find more of these murals.</p>

<h3>An aside:</h3>

<p>The amount of history in Philadelphia, especially regarding the founding of the United States and the beginning of the revolutionary war, was a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not ignorant of the history between the UK and the USA. Being British in the USA leads to good-natured ribbing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)">being a redcoat</a>. However, wandering around the centre of where the USA was founded and independence was sought is different. Everywhere there&rsquo;s information about how the revolutionaries were throwing off their repressive chains and seeking liberty. Implicit in all of the historical placards and explanatory signage was that they wanted to get away from the baddies. And in this case, the baddies were my ancestors (well, kinda).</p>

<p>I felt defensive, like I needed to stand up for my country: the UK wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad, was it? I&rsquo;m not a patriotic person, so feeling protective about my homeland was novel. I also felt conspicuous – that some tell would give me away, and people would be mad that the enemy was desecrating their site simply by standing there. I was sure I was only a moment away from being kicked out of the Constitution Museum or something.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really lived in another country, so I assume this is a pretty standard foreigner&rsquo;s paranoia. Maybe I should start wearing one of those sweet <a href="http://www.animalshirts.net/americanflagshirts/eaglefly.jpg">stars-and-stripes, eagle-soaring shirts</a> to blend in more.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/25/the-columbia-room/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-25T14:29:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/25/the-columbia-room</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was glad our friend had already been to <a href="http://columbiaroomdc.com/">The Columbia Room</a> and met us outside, otherwise I don&rsquo;t think we would have been able to find it. It&rsquo;s hidden in the back of an upscale dive bar called The Passenger on 7th St in D.C. Inside, it&rsquo;s tiny (I think there were ten seats) and sparsely-decorated (some apothecary-style bottles with herbs were behind the bar). The service, level of expertise from the bartenders, and the inventiveness of flavour pairings reminded me of the few Michelin-starred restaurants I&rsquo;ve been to. Except with liquor instead of food.</p>

<p>The set menu consists of three drinks and a couple of snacks, coming in at around $65 per person. Pricey, but definitely worth it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>After being offered cold towels scented with cucumber (!), we started out with a rum and lemon-based punch served in a teacup. It tasted pretty much like iced tea – but, y&#8217;know, alcoholic. So better than regular iced tea.</p>

<p>The second drink, the Getaway, had two main ingredients: a black rum and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynar">cynar</a> (<em>chee</em>-nar).</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/getaway-ingredients.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Ingredients for the Getaway</div>
</div>


<p>Cynar is a dark brown artichoke-based liqueur. It has a number of other spices in it, so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re drinking artichoke juice or anything. Mixed with the dark rum, some salted bitters and a bit of lemon, and wow. With each sip you went through four or five different flavour profiles – acidity of the lemon, saltiness, herbs, molasses. It was extremely drinkable and all three of us had to pace ourselves so we didn&rsquo;t finish it in two gulps.</p>

<p>The Getaway was served with an artichoke (to pair with the cynar) and green olive tapenade-type thing. It was pretty tasty, but I wish there had been more of it. Or maybe I should have eaten more for dinner.</p>

<p>For last cocktail of the set, we had a choice. Either a cynar and grapefruit/blood orange soda <strong>or</strong> a cynar and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit">akvavit</a> combination. Two of us plumped for the cynar/aquavit drink – it tasted a lot like a negroni. The soda drink was refreshing and a nice end to the tasting.</p>

<p>As the previous cocktails were so good, we decided to stay for another one each. We asked the bartender for two gin-based drinks – one with citrus and one without.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/dry-martini.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Dry Martini</div>
</div>


<p>Hampton got a dry martini with Plymouth gin. It was pretty delicious. The bartender recommended Plymouth as a good go-to gin that mixes well with other ingredients.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-ingredients.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Last Word Ingredients</div>
</div>


<p>I received a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Word_(cocktail)">Last Word</a> – Tanqueray 10 gin, Luxardo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino">maraschino liqueur</a>, lime juice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)">Chartreuse</a>. I had been drinking Chartreuse the previous Saturday, both neat and in a Chartreuse gimlet. I liked it a lot, so I was pretty excited it came up in the cocktail the bartender made for me here.</p>

<p>The Maraschino liqueur was strange. I&rsquo;m familiar with Luxardo-style maraschino cherries, so was expecting the liqueuer to be a deep purple syrup. However, it looked and tasted more like a simple syrup that had a hint of cherry flavour.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-cocktail.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Last Word</div>
</div>


<p>Mixing all of them together was amazing. The freshness of the limes worked well with the herbal qualities of the gin and the Chartreuse. The Maraschino added a touch of sweetness to round it all out. Apparently, the bartender likes to put a little more gin compared to normal Last Word-style drinks, which is what he said gives his the edge over the competition.</p>

<p>I highly recommend visiting this place if you&rsquo;re in the D.C. area. We managed to make reservations a couple of weeks in advance for a Wednesday night. I hear the building is being taken over soon – although I assume they will be moving to a new location.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/22/carry-on-packing-for-seven-months/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-22T13:09:09-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/22/carry-on-packing-for-seven-months</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">good friend</a> converted us to <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=7432">always packing carry-ons</a> when going on trips. It&rsquo;s far easier to travel with a carry-on – especially when taking low-cost airlines that charge to check luggage.</p>

<p>The longest we have spent living out of a carry-on has been about three months. The benefits definitely outweighed the negatives. If we ran out of clothes, we could often find laundry facilities. Anything we forgot could usually be bought locally. So, for this trip we took the plunge and aimed to pack only a carry-on for seven months of travel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to pack for seven months in a carry-on when you&rsquo;re travelling during summer. No hats, scarves, gloves, or bulky coats are necessary. Of course, when we make it back to the East Coast it will be autumn and may be a little chilly. At that point, we can easily buy warmer clothes (as <a href="https://twitter.com/hcatlin/status/458307183470342144">Hampton pointed out</a>, clothes tend to be more expensive in Europe).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Choosing things to pack was pretty simple. I went through T-shirts I liked and grabbed them. One pair of darker jeans (that could work in a nicer restaurant) is useful. Shirts that look good without needing to be ironed are helpful if you need a dressier option and don&rsquo;t have an iron handy.</p>

<p>I also made sure to pack some older clothes, too, so I could throw things out if necessary.</p>

<p>Getting it into the suitcase was simple by rolling everything up. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/06/business/businessspecial/20100506-pack-ss.html?_r=0">the &ldquo;roll&rdquo; style of packing</a>, it&rsquo;s excellent and allows you to fit a lot more in a suitcase (and keep things mostly wrinkle-free).</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/side-one.JPG">
  <div class="alt">First side</div>
</div>




<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/side-two.JPG">
  <div class="alt">Second side</div>
</div>


<p>The two images above contain about two weeks&#8217; worth of clothes.Making sure I wear bulky items when travelling means that the lighter versions (e.g. a lighter jacket, thinner shoes) fit in the suitcase. The contact lenses should be <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/medically-necessary-liquids">allowed as medical liquids</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 polo shirt</li>
<li>3 shirts</li>
<li>11 regular socks</li>
<li>7 ankle socks</li>
<li>16 pairs of underwear</li>
<li>2 pairs of trousers</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts</li>
<li>1 pair of swimming trunks</li>
<li>2 pairs of shoes (one boot-like, one light and foldable)</li>
<li>2 jackets (one light, one heavy)</li>
<li>1 toothbrush</li>
<li>1 razor</li>
<li>1 pair of sunglasses</li>
<li>90 pairs of contact lenses</li>
<li>1 international adaptor</li>
</ul>


<p>Our laptop bags will have toiletries (shaving cream, toothpaste and deodorant only – everything else we can buy as we need it), our laptops, kindles, and chargers.</p>

<p>And there you go. That&rsquo;s how you pack for seven months in only carry-on.</p>

</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things worth mentioning about these last few letters of the alphabet. X and Z were surprisingly good considering they were &ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; letters.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help comparing Revolutionary Road with Rabbit, Run. They had broadly similar themes, in my head. Unhappy couples in the 1950s/60s who live dull lives. I thought Revolutionary Road did this far, far better. I understood the characters. Updike seemed to write off Rabbit&rsquo;s wife as unexplainable &ndash; she was incredibly two-dimensional. Compared with April Wheeler, which was a very sympathetic portrait of a woman trapped in a life she didn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll do a longer wrap-up post this weekend on LIFE-LESSONS and such.</p>

<p>Two things. First, I really didn&rsquo;t understand Rabbit, Run and I need to find someone who&rsquo;s read that (and preferably the other ones in the series) to discuss it with.</p>

<p>Second, I&rsquo;m almost there! Just four more letters left. I think I&rsquo;ll make it before 2014 starts. I must admit, this challenge wasn&rsquo;t as satisfying as War and Peace. It&rsquo;s been good to get to some new authors, but I&rsquo;ve found myself wanting to stray too much. At least with War and Peace I could still read other books.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://localeditionsf.com/">Local Edition</a> on Market at 3rd, there&rsquo;s a nice bourbon-based cocktail called the Brass Check. I think it&rsquo;s my favourite on their menu. The grapefruit comes through, but the syrup softens it so it&rsquo;s not too sour. The Rosebud is pretty good, too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you eat at a fancy restaurant (or at least a restaurant with a world-renowned chef), you have to get the weirdest thing on the menu. That chef (or restaurant) is famous for a reason &ndash; it creates flavour profiles that are going to be pleasing. So why waste your time on something standard?</p>

  <div class="alt">Breakfast of Champions</div>
</div>


<p>That philosophy was how I ended up getting the Breakfast of Champions cocktail, pictured above, at <a href="http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/">ad hoc</a> the other weekend. Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>St George Botanivore gin</li>
<li>Fruit Loop-infused milk</li>
<li>Egg white</li>
</ul>


<p>It was so. bloody. delicious. In fact, I called the bartender over to congratulate him. The cocktail had only been on the menu for about a week, and he seemed chuffed with my praise. He even brought over some of the milk for us to try.</p>

<p>The cocktail itself was a more floral/fruity version of a standard sour drink. It wasn&rsquo;t too heavy and didn&rsquo;t have that gross milk aftertaste. It was seriously good. I must figure out how to make it at home.</p>

<p>Seriously, at nice restaurants always try something you think sounds gross.</p>

</ul>


<p>As I&rsquo;m just over half-way through the alphabet, I&rsquo;m going to do a top five books so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I, Claudius &ndash; Graves</li>
<li>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius &ndash; Eggers</li>
<li>Dubliners &ndash; Joyce</li>
<li>Under the Skin &ndash; Faber</li>
<li>In Cold Blood &ndash; Capote</li>
</ol>


<p>° I couldn&rsquo;t even finish it. I made it to the half-way point, then had to stop. The book is supposed to be (partly) a take on Joyce, but I found the obfuscated narrative unreadable. Maybe this is what Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake is like?</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/04/04/d-e-f</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on from my previous post, the next three novels I read were by authors with surnames beginning with D, E, and F:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._L._Doctorow">E.L. Doctorow</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Daniel_(novel)">The Book of Daniel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers">Dave Eggers</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius">A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Faber">Michel Faber</a> &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(novel)">Under the Skin</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I totally didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; The Book of Daniel. It was semi-interesting from a historical perspective &ndash; in the US stories are very rarely told from a communist viewpoint. The style was too disjointed for me to enjoy the book (I&rsquo;m usually OK with that but&hellip; not here, for some reason). So yeah, not my favourite so far.</p>

<p>AHWoSG was staggering (shut up, I had to). I loved it. Being a recent (ok, recent-ish) SF transplant, I love anything that involves the Bay Area (I <em>really</em> wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Widow">Red Widow</a> to be good and I&rsquo;m stupidly excited about <a href="http://sfist.com/2013/03/28/new_hbo_pilot_about_gay_thirtysomet.php">a pilot for some HBO show they&rsquo;re currently filming</a>).</p>

<p>But even aside from the SF-love, it was a moving account of an unusual relationship between two brothers. I&rsquo;m 93% sure I&rsquo;m the last person to have read this book, though, so everyone knows how awesome it is already. Oh, and bonus points because I&rsquo;m now watching reruns of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_World:_San_Francisco">The Real World San Francisco</a> and a couple of the characters appear in the novel.</p>

<p>I also really dug Under the Skin, despite its vegetarian preachiness. I&rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for sci-fi that&rsquo;s less about the sci and more about the fi. The central character was a pretty fascinating one. They&rsquo;re apparently making a film of it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>. I&rsquo;m puzzling on how they&rsquo;re going to treat some of the more gruesome aspects of the book.</p>

<p>The next trio of GHI are pretty long, so it might be a while before another update.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-03T14:02:56-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/03/03/a-b-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace">War and Peace</a> &ndash; it has 365 chapters, so fit neatly into one year at a chapter a day. It was nice having a challenge to finish such an epic book and gave me a reason to read every day.</p>

<p>I needed to come up with a challenge for 2013 (although it&rsquo;ll probably spill into 2014). After writing down a list of books I wanted to read, I noticed that there was a string of authors with surnames starting with consecutive letters of the alphabet. I started expanding the list to fit other letters. The only rule is that I can&rsquo;t have read the author before.</p>

<p>So, this is the start of the A-Z Book Challenge. My first three books were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(novel)">Money</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Amis">Martin Amis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths">Labyrinths</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote">Truman Capote</a>.</p>

<p>My favourite was probably Money. It was interesting and fun to read an author who has been influential to other authors I&rsquo;ve read in ways I didn&rsquo;t realise. The central character, John Self, was one of the strongest and most fascinating narrators I&rsquo;ve read in a while.</p>

<p>Labyrinths took me a while to get into. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of the ideas presented in other ways (e.g. science fiction movies), but some of the stories resonated. In particular, I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_the_Sword">The Form of the Sword</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">The Garden of Forking Paths</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote">Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</a>. The last one in particular stuck with me, for some reason &ndash; maybe its relevance to copyright, plagiarism, etc. and the internet?</p>

<p>In Cold Blood was great. I went through it surprisingly fast &ndash; it was an easy read. I understand it&rsquo;s probably more fiction than fact, but Perry Smith was a seriously likeable character(/person?).</p>

<p>Anyway, next up: The Book of Daniel by E. L. Doctorow.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-05T14:10:32-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2013/01/05/midsummer-house</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We were in the UK for Christmas, and my parents told us to keep one evening free from seeing our friends &ndash; they had a plan. They didn&rsquo;t tell us what it was &ndash; not even on the cab ride there. We were equally intrigued (what could it be? It had to be dinner, right?) and anxious (what if we didn&rsquo;t like it?).</p>

<p>As we entered the backroads of northern Cambridge, we realised we were going to <a href="http://www.midsummerhouse.co.uk/">Midsummer House</a>, the 2-Michelin-starred restaurant where we got married just over three years ago. Needless to say, we were both incredibly excited. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was incredible. I think it supersedes other meals I&rsquo;ve had there to be the best meal of my life. I took some pictures, so here you go:</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/bloody-mary.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Bloody Mary amuse-bouche
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/goats-cheese.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Celery, goat&#8217;s cheese, and horseradish ice-cream.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/scallop.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Sautéed scallop, celeriac and truffle.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/trestle.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Before the third course arrived, we had this placed in front of us&#8230;
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/sweetbreads.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Turns out, it was to hold this: sweetbreads, pistachio, maple syrup and mouli.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/brill.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Roast brill, surf clams, cucumber, wasabi, sorrel.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/beef.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Beef fillet, sautéed tongue, horseradish, turnip and Paris browns.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/pousse-cafe.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Pousse-café - maple syrup, egg-yolk, and Jack Daniels and chive foam.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/kumkwats.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Poached kumquats with lemon and thyme ice-cream.
  </div>
</div>


<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/midsummer-house/chocolate.jpg">
  <div class="alt">
    Chocolate, caramel and chestnuts, chestnut frangipane.
  </div>
</div>


<p>I missed two courses: a broccoli, pear and blue cheese starter and an apple crumble thing with baked yoghurt. Both were intense and I must have dove in without thinking to take a picture.</p>

<p>The meal took four hours and I loved every minute of it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2012/02/25/the-artist/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-25T14:21:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2012/02/25/the-artist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it&rsquo;s the Oscars tomorrow, we decided to watch The Artist. I think it&rsquo;s still the frontrunner for the major awards, so it seems appropriate. And this year I&rsquo;m really excited, as it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ll be able to watch the Academy Awards LIVE! (I&rsquo;m a dork, I know.)</p>

<p>It was pretty awesome, I must say. At first the lack of dialogue was (weirdly enough) distracting, but I soon got into it. The two leads are adorable, as is the dog. I want to own that dog. The music was great (I guess you have to have pretty awesome music if you&rsquo;re going to make a silent film&hellip;).</p>

<p>There was one thing I found annoying, and it&rsquo;s a bit of a spoiler, so&hellip; <strong>spoiler warning</strong>! It was the very end. Firstly, I thought leaving it at &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; would have been a cleaner finish. Secondly, hearing Dujardin say &ldquo;with pleasure!&rdquo; in his super-French accent was weird. I was watching the film not imagining him to be French and&hellip; I dunno, for me it broke the illusion. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that he&rsquo;s French. It was just jarring. OK, <strong>spoilers over</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great choice for Best Picture tomorrow. It&rsquo;s got the nostalgia, the appreciation for film as an art-form, and a crowd-pleasing storyline.</p>

<p>In fact, it makes me happy I enjoyed it so much. When the nominees for this year&rsquo;s Oscars were announced, I was seriously disappointed. One measly mention each for Drive (Best Sound Editing) and The Ides of March (Best Adapted Screenplay). No major awards for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (bar the Best Actress nod). Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve only seen three of the Best Picture nominees (Hugo, Moneyball and now The Artist) &ndash; but two of them I didn&rsquo;t like. So liking The Artist at least gives me a film to root for. (I&rsquo;d still like Gary Oldman to win for Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, though.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;ll probably post something after the awards tomorrow, with my disdain for the winners&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first post on SF was a bit tourist-y. This one will be more focused on food and drink. And other funstuff.</p>

<p>We ate at a neat burger place on Union Sq &ndash; the aptly-named <a href="http://www.burger-bar.com/">Burger Bar</a>.</p>

  <div class="alt">The burger I had. I think it was buffalo?</div>
</div>


<p>The milkshakes (picture missing) were amazing. The nutella one was just ice-cream and nutella, pretty much. The burger was good&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve had better (I&rsquo;m looking at you, The Bird in Berlin.)</p>

<p>We went to an awesome beach &ndash; China Beach. It was really quiet and had insane views of the Golden Gate and its bridge.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/san-francisco/china-beach.jpg">
</div>


<p>Oh, and something else I&rsquo;d highly recommend is Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It&rsquo;s on every Thursday and has a general theme every week (we went for 80s nostalgia/comedy). They have booze, you can wander around the exhibits, and they play pretty awesome music.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all I have to say. If you keep track of my whereabouts, you&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve now moved to San Francisco to live. It&rsquo;s awesome here!</p>

<p>We flew United 2623 from CLT to SFO. They had WIFI!!!!! Zomg. It&rsquo;s still a novelty for me. I don&rsquo;t have many photos of the CLT-SFO flight, just the food pretty much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been to San Francisco before, so it was a bit of an adventure. We only spent a couple of days doing touristy things, and the rest of the time was mostly Hampton working at Moovweb and me working on the book. Here&rsquo;s some tourist photos.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So&hellip; I really need to start blogging about an amazing trip I&rsquo;ve been on. It&rsquo;s been going for about two months now. It started in July, when we moved out of our apartment in Cambridge, England.</p>

  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/cambridge/boxes.jpg">
  <div class="alt">All our stuff in boxes hours before we left.</div>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve visited seven cities, from Honolulu to Berlin. It&rsquo;ll probably take me a while to blog about them all. Here&rsquo;s a brief itinerary:</p>

<p>LGW &ndash; TPA (25th July 2011)</p>

<p>JAX &ndash; CLT &ndash; SFO (8th August 2011)</p>

<p>SFO &ndash; HNL &ndash; KOA (23rd August 2011)</p>

<p>KOA &ndash; HNL (30th August 2011)</p>

<p>HNL &ndash; LAX &ndash; LHR (1st September 2011)</p>
