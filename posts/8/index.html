  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following on from my previous post, the next three novels I read were by authors with surnames beginning with D, E, and F:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._L._Doctorow">E.L. Doctorow</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Daniel_(novel)">The Book of Daniel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers">Dave Eggers</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius">A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Faber">Michel Faber</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(novel)">Under the Skin</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I totally didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; The Book of Daniel. It was semi-interesting from a historical perspective - in the US stories are very rarely told from a communist viewpoint. The style was too disjointed for me to enjoy the book (I&rsquo;m usually OK with that but&hellip; not here, for some reason). So yeah, not my favourite so far.</p>

<p>AHWoSG was staggering (shut up, I had to). I loved it. Being a recent (ok, recent-ish) SF transplant, I love anything that involves the Bay Area (I <em>really</em> wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Widow">Red Widow</a> to be good and I&rsquo;m stupidly excited about <a href="http://sfist.com/2013/03/28/new_hbo_pilot_about_gay_thirtysomet.php">a pilot for some HBO show they&rsquo;re currently filming</a>).</p>

<p>But even aside from the SF-love, it was a moving account of an unusual relationship between two brothers. I&rsquo;m 93% sure I&rsquo;m the last person to have read this book, though, so everyone knows how awesome it is already. Oh, and bonus points because I&rsquo;m now watching reruns of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_World:_San_Francisco">The Real World San Francisco</a> and a couple of the characters appear in the novel.</p>

<p>I also really dug Under the Skin, despite its vegetarian preachiness. I&rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for sci-fi that&rsquo;s less about the sci and more about the fi. The central character was a pretty fascinating one. They&rsquo;re apparently making a film of it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>. I&rsquo;m puzzling on how they&rsquo;re going to treat some of the more gruesome aspects of the book.</p>

<p>The next trio of GHI are pretty long, so it might be a while before another update.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace">War and Peace</a> - it has 365 chapters, so fit neatly into one year at a chapter a day. It was nice having a challenge to finish such an epic book and gave me a reason to read every day.</p>

<p>I needed to come up with a challenge for 2013 (although it&rsquo;ll probably spill into 2014). After writing down a list of books I wanted to read, I noticed that there was a string of authors with surnames starting with consecutive letters of the alphabet. I started expanding the list to fit other letters. The only rule is that I can&rsquo;t have read the author before.</p>

<p>So, this is the start of the A-Z Book Challenge. My first three books were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(novel)">Money</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Amis">Martin Amis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths">Labyrinths</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote">Truman Capote</a>.</p>

<p>My favourite was probably Money. It was interesting and fun to read an author who has been influential to other authors I&rsquo;ve read in ways I didn&rsquo;t realise. The central character, John Self, was one of the strongest and most fascinating narrators I&rsquo;ve read in a while.</p>

<p>Labyrinths took me a while to get into. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of the ideas presented in other ways (e.g. science fiction movies), but some of the stories resonated. In particular, I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_the_Sword">The Form of the Sword</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">The Garden of Forking Paths</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote">Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</a>. The last one in particular stuck with me, for some reason - maybe its relevance to copyright, plagiarism, etc. and the internet?</p>

<p>In Cold Blood was great. I went through it surprisingly fast - it was an easy read. I understand it&rsquo;s probably more fiction than fact, but Perry Smith was a seriously likeable character(/person?).</p>

<p>Anyway, next up: The Book of Daniel by E. L. Doctorow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were in the UK for Christmas, and my parents told us to keep one evening free from seeing our friends - they had a plan. They didn&rsquo;t tell us what it was - not even on the cab ride there. We were equally intrigued (what could it be? It had to be dinner, right?) and anxious (what if we didn&rsquo;t like it?).</p>

<p>As we entered the backroads of northern Cambridge, we realised we were going to <a href="http://www.midsummerhouse.co.uk/">Midsummer House</a>, the 2-Michelin-starred restaurant where we got married just over three years ago. Needless to say, we were both incredibly excited. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was incredible. I think it supersedes other meals I&rsquo;ve had there to be the best meal of my life. I took some pictures, so here you go:</p>

<p>I missed two courses: a broccoli, pear and blue cheese starter and an apple crumble thing with baked yoghurt. Both were intense and I must have dove in without thinking to take a picture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As it&rsquo;s the Oscars tomorrow, we decided to watch The Artist. I think it&rsquo;s still the frontrunner for the major awards, so it seems appropriate. And this year I&rsquo;m really excited, as it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ll be able to watch the Academy Awards LIVE! (I&rsquo;m a dork, I know.)</p>

<p>It was pretty awesome, I must say. At first the lack of dialogue was (weirdly enough) distracting, but I soon got into it. The two leads are adorable, as is the dog. I want to own that dog. The music was great (I guess you have to have pretty awesome music if you&rsquo;re going to make a silent film&hellip;).</p>

<p>There was one thing I found annoying, and it&rsquo;s a bit of a spoiler, so&hellip; <strong>spoiler warning</strong>! It was the very end. Firstly, I thought leaving it at &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; would have been a cleaner finish. Secondly, hearing Dujardin say &ldquo;with pleasure!&rdquo; in his super-French accent was weird. I was watching the film not imagining him to be French and&hellip; I dunno, for me it broke the illusion. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that he&rsquo;s French. It was just jarring. OK, <strong>spoilers over</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great choice for Best Picture tomorrow. It&rsquo;s got the nostalgia, the appreciation for film as an art-form, and a crowd-pleasing storyline.</p>

<p>In fact, it makes me happy I enjoyed it so much. When the nominees for this year&rsquo;s Oscars were announced, I was seriously disappointed. One measly mention each for Drive (Best Sound Editing) and The Ides of March (Best Adapted Screenplay). No major awards for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (bar the Best Actress nod). Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve only seen three of the Best Picture nominees (Hugo, Moneyball and now The Artist) - but two of them I didn&rsquo;t like. So liking The Artist at least gives me a film to root for. (I&rsquo;d still like Gary Oldman to win for Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, though.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;ll probably post something after the awards tomorrow, with my disdain for the winners&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first post on SF was a bit tourist-y. This one will be more focused on food and drink. And other funstuff.</p>

<p>We ate at a neat burger place on Union Sq - the aptly-named <a href="http://www.burger-bar.com/">Burger Bar</a>.</p>

<p>The milkshakes (picture missing) were amazing. The nutella one was just ice-cream and nutella, pretty much. The burger was good&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve had better (I&rsquo;m looking at you, The Bird in Berlin.)</p>

<p>We went to an awesome beach - China Beach. It was really quiet and had insane views of the Golden Gate and its bridge.</p>

<p>Oh, and something else I&rsquo;d highly recommend is Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It&rsquo;s on every Thursday and has a general theme every week (we went for 80s nostalgia/comedy). They have booze, you can wander around the exhibits, and they play pretty awesome music.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all I have to say. If you keep track of my whereabouts, you&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve now moved to San Francisco to live. It&rsquo;s awesome here!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Jacksonville, we headed on to San Francisco. Hampton&rsquo;s company (Moovweb) is based there.</p>

<p>We flew United 2623 from CLT to SFO. They had WIFI!!!!! Zomg. It&rsquo;s still a novelty for me. I don&rsquo;t have many photos of the CLT-SFO flight, just the food pretty much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been to San Francisco before, so it was a bit of an adventure. We only spent a couple of days doing touristy things, and the rest of the time was mostly Hampton working at Moovweb and me working on the book. Here&rsquo;s some tourist photos.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve visited seven cities, from Honolulu to Berlin. It&rsquo;ll probably take me a while to blog about them all. Here&rsquo;s a brief itinerary:</p>

<p>LGW - TPA (25th July 2011)</p>

<p>JAX - CLT - SFO (8th August 2011)</p>

<p>SFO - HNL - KOA (23rd August 2011)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend, we went to London to see some of our best friends. We only really had an afternoon and evening. We started by heading to South Kensington and wandering around the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">V&amp;A</a> for a bit. I love the V&amp;A. It&rsquo;s got enough variety to keep things interesting. We visited rooms on architecture,  Islamic history and British design in the late Victorian era in the space of a couple of hours. Awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, we went to a pub, then to sushi at <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/52/565671/restaurant/London/Kulu-Kulu-Sushi-South-Kensington">Kulu Kulu</a>, a conveyor belt place. Lots of delicious food&hellip; but weirdly lacking on the fish. Still, I&rsquo;m not complaining. Their stewed aubergine thing with soy sauce was amazing. Nom!</p>

<p>One of our friends had heard about an absinthe bar nearby. In fact, it was underneath a restaurant (the <a href="http://www.bromptonbarandgrill.com/">Brompton Bar &amp; Grill</a>). I&rsquo;ve never had absinthe before. Although it&rsquo;d been banned in the USA and France, it was always legal in the UK. I guess no one liked it enough for it to present much of a &ldquo;danger&rdquo; to society. Now the green fairy is being legalised in many countries, drinking absinthe is finding a resurgence.</p>

<p>We decided to skip cocktails with absinthe and go straight to the pure stuff. There was a great theatricality to the process. A water cooler (in 19th century French style, of course) was put on the table with four miniature taps.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>This was filled with ice-cold water. (Sorry the pictures are so dark. It was underground and mainly lit by candles.)</p>

<p>We got a small glass with some absinthe in. Balanced on top was a special spoon (shaped like a leaf) with holes in it. A brown sugar cube was placed on top. You put the sugar cube underneath the tap and slowly let the water drip onto the cube. The sugar dissolves and drips down into the absinthe, diluting and sweetening it.</p>

<p>Once all that&rsquo;s done, you can drink away. It wasn&rsquo;t as liquorice-y as I thought it might be. Which is good, because I hate liquorice. It was certainly an enjoyable experience, even if I didn&rsquo;t hallucinate.</p>

<p>After that, we made a trek to the north-east of London to the <a href="http://www.whistlingshop.com/">Worship Street Whistling Shop</a>. It&rsquo;s a Victorian-themed bar, with many gin-based drinks. It was too dark to take decent photos inside - but there were lots of barrels and canvas-covered stools. The waiters were dressed in something akin to what barbers wear.</p>

<p>Anyway, the drinks here were <strong>a-mazing</strong>. Pricey, but still. I got the &ldquo;Panacea&rdquo; (Compass Box Whisky, honey and lavender shrub, lemon juice and sage dust) the first time around, then the Civility Cocktail (Lillet Blanc, Martini Extra Dry, WS2 Exhaustion Tonic and WS2 raspberry syrup). They were super-tasty. I&rsquo;d highly recommend this place. Apparently, this is the second bar this company has opened - so I desperately want to visit their first, a speakeasy near Marylebone called <a href="http://www.purl-london.com/">Purl</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&rsquo;t realise that Lyon was the centre for French gastronomy. But apparently it is. Anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d devote a whole post to the food I ate there, in addition to my first post on the city itself.</p>

<p>The first night, we ate at <a href="http://www.brasseriegeorges.com/">Brasserie Georges</a>. It&rsquo;s apparently pretty famous (it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasserie_Georges">Wikipedia article</a> - a sure sign of prominence). They served some traditional Lyon food - including a pistachio sausage thing, which was pretty nice. Also on the list of traditional Lyon foods were a mustard sausage and calf&rsquo;s head. I think I made the right choice with a pistachio sausage.</p>

<p>The second evening, we went to a place called <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1256&amp;bih=738&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Les+enfants+terribles+lyon&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=Les+enfants+terribles&amp;hnear=0x47f4ea516ae88797:0x408ab2ae4bb21f0,Lyon,+France&amp;cid=9879979365541420669">Les Enfants Terribles</a>&hellip; it was OK. Nothing too special. The duck salad I had to start had too much mustard dressing on it. The main was beef, coupled with some deeeeelicious dauphinoise potatoes. I think they must have used chicken stock or something. The dessert was pretty good&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not much of a surprise as I love all tartes au citron. The filling had a strange granular texture - I think they might have added ground almonds or something.</p>

<p>For Sunday lunch, we went to a pretty decent restaurant near the hotel (in the Brotteaux area) - it was called <a href="http://www.nordsudbrasseries.com/">Brasserie de l&#8217;Est</a>. It seems to be part of a chain. The food was pretty good! I&rsquo;d recommend it. I forgot to take pictures, though.</p>

<p>On our final night, we ended up at <a href="http://www.hippopotamus.fr/">Hippopotamus</a>. I&rsquo;ve seen a few in Paris. They&rsquo;re some kind of chain that serves vaguely French food - steaks, etc. It was, as we kinda expected, mediocre. I had an assortment of fried goods. It was very American.</p>

<p>One of the better meals I had was (strangely?) at the airport. It was the airport branch of the 2-Michelin-starred <a href="http://www.nicolaslebec.com/">Nicolas Le Bec</a>, which is in the centre of Lyon. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.espace-lebec.com/">Espace Le Bec</a>. We both had a really delicious penne with bolognese. It had the most amazing cheese sliced over it, too. SO GOOD.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much all the food I ate in Lyon. I wasn&rsquo;t there that long, so I can&rsquo;t really confirm or deny its status as le centre gastronomique of France. I&rsquo;ve had better meals in Paris. (But Espace Le Bec was definitely the best meal I&rsquo;ve had at an airport.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t visited many cities in France. Honestly, I&rsquo;m a bit lazy. I think, &ldquo;Why would you want to go anywhere other than Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However! Hampton was invited to a conference in Lyon (<a href="http://rulu.eu/">Ruby Lugdunum</a>, named after the Roman moniker for the town). As we were mostly either at the conference or eating, I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to look around most of the city. But I&rsquo;m still going to judge it based on what I did see.</p>

<p>The hotel was pretty damn good, actually. It was called <a href="http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-7236-mercure-lyon-brotteaux/index.shtml">Hotel Mercure</a>. They had a nice French breakfast every morning (mmm, croissants). It was pretty central, and the staff were nice.</p>

<p>Lyon itself was much more of a city-city than Paris. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re in Paris, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine someone actually living there. Lyon is a bustling place, with very few tourists. It feels like a financial centre.</p>

<p>The architecture was odd. I guess the city had mostly grown in the 60s/70s. There was lots of brutalist stuff - not that I&rsquo;m complaining, as I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut">b√©ton</a> look. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard_University_Lyon_1">The Universit√© Lyon 1</a> (where the conference was held) was made up pretty much exclusively of this stuff.</p>

<p>Although the buildings were interesting, they&rsquo;d been left to a surprising amount of decay. Paint peeling, weeds growing everywhere. It was pretty strange.</p>

<p>Oh, and on the topic of architecture, LYS had an awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">train station</a>, designed by Santiago Calatrava.</p>

<p>It was super-easy to use the city&rsquo;s transportation. The metro is neat and seems to go to all the major places in the city.</p>

<p>Next post: food.</p>
