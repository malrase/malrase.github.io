  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t visited many cities in France. Honestly, I&rsquo;m a bit lazy. I think, &ldquo;Why would you want to go anywhere other than Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However! Hampton was invited to a conference in Lyon (<a href="http://rulu.eu/">Ruby Lugdunum</a>, named after the Roman moniker for the town). As we were mostly either at the conference or eating, I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to look around most of the city. But I&rsquo;m still going to judge it based on what I did see.</p>

</div>


<p>The hotel was pretty damn good, actually. It was called <a href="http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-7236-mercure-lyon-brotteaux/index.shtml">Hotel Mercure</a>. They had a nice French breakfast every morning (mmm, croissants). It was pretty central, and the staff were nice.</p>

<p>Lyon itself was much more of a city-city than Paris. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re in Paris, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine someone actually living there. Lyon is a bustling place, with very few tourists. It feels like a financial centre.</p>

<p>The architecture was odd. I guess the city had mostly grown in the 60s/70s. There was lots of brutalist stuff &ndash; not that I&rsquo;m complaining, as I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut">béton</a> look. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard_University_Lyon_1">The Université Lyon 1</a> (where the conference was held) was made up pretty much exclusively of this stuff.</p>

<p>Although the buildings were interesting, they&rsquo;d been left to a surprising amount of decay. Paint peeling, weeds growing everywhere. It was pretty strange.</p>

<p>Oh, and on the topic of architecture, LYS had an awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">train station</a>, designed by Santiago Calatrava.</p>

<p>It was super-easy to use the city&rsquo;s transportation. The metro is neat and seems to go to all the major places in the city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After our trip to Zürich, we went to Paris by train. As with most rail travel in Europe, it was a great way to move between cities. There was a lot of kerfuffle with the hotels when we arrived &ndash; but we ended up in the beautiful <a href="http://www.closmedicis.com/">Hotel de Clos Medicis</a>. We were in the attic, which had amazing exposed beams and an upstairs bathroom.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/paris/medicis.jpg">
    <img src="/images/paris/medicis.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Our room (in the attic) in the hotel.</div>
</div>


<p>Best of all, we were in the Latin Quarter, which is so much fun. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;bohemian&rdquo; area of Paris, with lots of cool bars, cafés and restaurants to eat in. Which is what we mainly ended up doing.Hampton and I have done most of the touristy things in Paris before &ndash; and we were there in March, too. When we were there, we discovered our love for the café culture. Seriously, why hasn&rsquo;t it been rolled out across the world yet? We would sit in a café from 3pm until 7pm reading, drinking wine. We&rsquo;d go for a meal somewhere, then return to another café for more wine, leaving at around 2am. It&rsquo;s so refreshing.</p>

<p>Anyway, this time we tried to do the same thing. We ate a lot of good food. My favourite restaurant was <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d715085-Reviews-Fish_la_Boissonnerie-Paris_Ile_de_France.html">Fish Le Boissonnerie</a>. Some pictures follow.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of the bread, though. The bread (which I think they got from an Italian restaurant across the street) was the most amazing foccacia I have ever tasted. I&rsquo;d go back to that restaurant solely for the bread.</p>

<p>So, other random things we did in Paris. We went on a boat tour along the Seine, which was nice. But it was super hot (a lot warmer than Zürich, that&rsquo;s for sure).</p>

</div>


<p>We visited the <a href="http://equipement.paris.fr/marche-aux-fleurs-et-aux-oiseaux-cite-4506">marché des oiseaux</a> on Sunday. Every Sunday, the flower market on the Île de la Cité also has a bunch of guys selling birds. It was bizarre, and unsettling how many birds they can fit into those tiny cages.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">So many birds in such a small cage.</div>

<p>As for cafés, my favourite is still <a href="https://plus.google.com/117060472644786113352/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en">Le Contrescarpe</a>, on Rue Mouffetard. However, the best wine was definitely at <a href="http://www.michelrostang.com/">Le Rostand</a>, which was facing the Jardin du Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t really go to that many &ldquo;bars&rdquo;, but we did go to <a href="http://www.bowlingmouffetard.fr/">Le Bowling Mouffetard</a>, a mix of Americana and UV lighting &ndash; in a bowling alley. That was very enjoyable. I remember going when I was in Paris in 2006. I&rsquo;m surprised I managed to find it again.</p>

<p>As the Royal Wedding is coming up, every French magazine seemed to have a cover story about the couple. This one really weirded me out:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our best friends, Mike and Melissa, decided to take a holiday to Europe. As this is on our doorstep, we tagged along. The vacation started in Zürich for four days, then moved to Paris for another four days.</p>

<p>It all started with a two-hour flight from the abysmal &ldquo;London&rdquo; Luton Airport, which brought us to ZRH. We arrived at 17:30 and got a brief train to the central station. Walking outside, we could easily see the architectural monstrosity that was the Marriott Zürich &ndash; our hotel for four days. The <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/zrhdt-zurich-marriott-hotel/">Marriott</a> was far enough out of town to make it a nuisance to get to. It was a 15-minute walk to our friends&#8217; hotel, the much more conveniently-located <a href="http://www.hotel-adler.ch/">Hotel Adler</a> on Niederdorfstrasse.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/zurich/waiting.jpg">
    <img src="/images/zurich/waiting.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Waiting outside Hotel Adler</div>
</div>


<p>First thing&rsquo;s first &ndash; Zürich is very expensive. As I&rsquo;m writing this, the Swiss Franc is particularly strong against the USD, the Euro and the GBP. Beers cost 5F on average, and cocktails are easily 17F. Even a gin and tonic at <a href="http://www.spottedbylocals.com/zurich/kontiki-pub/">Kon-Tiki</a> was 13F. Very slimming for the wallet.</p>

<p>Secondly, Zürich was pretty chilly. I thought I&rsquo;d put my scarf away for the spring, but I had to bring it back out for this leg of the trip. (Although Mike and Melissa, hailing from Toronto, said it was about the same temperature as there&hellip;)</p>

<p>We tried to eat fairly traditionally. We ate at a couple of &ldquo;bierhalles&rdquo; &ndash; bench-style seating with various schnitzels and wursts on offer. The <a href="http://www.trymarket.ch/zeughauskeller/index.htm">Zeughauskeller</a>, at the southern end of Banhofstrasse, was very good. I wanted to take home vats of their potato salad.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/zurich/potato-salad.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Delicious potato salad</div>
</div>


<p>We (of course) also ate at a fondue restaurant (underneath Hotel Adler, the <a href="http://www.hotel-adler.ch/restaurant-swiss-chuchi/">Chuchi</a>). Fondue is difficult to get wrong, really. Melt some cheese, add some alcohol and boom goes the dynamite. We ordered a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and a &ldquo;speciality&rdquo; pot, and found we were evenly split as to which we thought was the best.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Fondue at Chuchi</div>
</div>


<p>On our first night (Melissa&rsquo;s birthday), we ate at <a href="http://www.hiltl.ch/">Hiltl</a>, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Europe. It was pretty good &ndash; I had some amazing fried tofu, and stole some of Hampton&rsquo;s truffle risotto. Nom nom, indeed.</p>

<p>Hiltl had its twitter feed mentions projected on the wall!
Activity-wise, I think there&rsquo;s a fair amount to do in Zürich. However, we didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot. We went on a boat-tour of the lake and river, which was pleasant (especially in the gorgeous sunshine we received). We also went to the <a href="http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/">Museum für Gestaltung Zürich</a> (a design museum), which was neat. It had a cool exhibition on the visual use of text, with a few music videos (including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J4O2-nsFBA">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a> by Dylan) and opening titles to movies (e.g. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZK7mJoPLY">Se7en</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqIclb4qsJI">Panic Room</a>).</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/zurich/museum.jpg">
    <img src="/images/zurich/museum.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Outside the Museum für Gestaltung</div>
</div>


<p>We mainly went to cafes (for example, the <a href="http://www.odeon.ch/">Cafe Odeon</a> &ndash; frequented by Lenin and Tchaikovsky, apparently) and bars (for example, <a href="http://www.wings-lounge.ch/">Wings</a>, an airline-themed bar). It was fun, though. Last time we went (February 2010), we coupled the trip with some skiing &ndash; which was a lot of fun, too.</p>

<p>So, all in all, it was a good holiday. The second leg, Paris, is up next.</p>
