    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week was the second <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a>. After having a blast last year, we had to come back (and it gave us a great excuse to be in New York City for a while).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/itsmisscs">Claudina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Snugug">Sam</a>, and the other organisers did a great job of having community events for the whole week in the run-up to the conference. A large number of SassConf attendees were staying in New York for a while, so it was a great idea to have some &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; community events beforehand.</p>

<p>There were great talks by <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith Schwartz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickhamann">Patrick Hamann</a> on Monday night. On Wednesday there was a fireside chat with the Sass Design team. Hampton talked about the original concept behind Sass and its unconventional branding, then <a href="https://twitter.com/jina">Jina Bolton</a> walked through the complete redesign of the <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass website</a> that she spearheaded last year.</p>

</div>


<p>It was a fitting topic – at last year&rsquo;s SassConf, the new website was launched. <a href="https://twitter.com/bermonpainter">Bermon Painter</a> joined in to explain the new logo, too. It was an entertaining evening.</p>

<p>The first day of the conference consisted of talks. It was neat hearing from <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una</a> about the global Sass community, and I always enjoy listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith</a> talk about art and how you can bring art into your everyday life.</p>

<p>It was also great to finally give <a href="https://twitter.com/nex3">Natalie</a> the <a href="https://thenetawards.com/">net Game-Changer of the Year award</a>. It was picked up by <a href="https://twitter.com/kaelig">Kaelig</a> back in May. He gave it to us when we were in London, then we asked my Mum to ship it to New York for SassConf.</p>

<p>The next day was workshop-based. I wasn&rsquo;t able to go to any, but from what I could see on Twitter people had a great time and learnt a lot.</p>

<p>The after-party was on Friday night, and it involved a boat trip (with open bar and karaoke) around the bottom of Manhattan. I guess boats are &ldquo;in&rdquo; at conferences – we did a boat trip for lunch during <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">LaConf</a> in Paris.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was <em>awesome</em>. Seeing any city from a new perspective is great, and Manhattan is absolutely gorgeous at night.</p>

</div>


<p>We sailed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Piers">Chelsea Piers</a> to near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. Then, on the way back, we got really close to the Statue of Liberty!</p>

</div>


<p>The number of attendees at the conference was small enough that you recognised most people at the after-party. I felt like I could go up to anyone and strike up a conversation. Everyone had a great time.</p>

<p>The next day was the &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; – something I&rsquo;m not familiar with at all. The idea is that people would form their own groups to talk/discuss/code about what they&rsquo;re feeling passionate about. I must admit, I was pretty sceptical going into the day. I expected it to end up being isolated people working on their own thing, with minimal discussions.</p>

<p>I was very wrong.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The unconference was held in the New Work City offices</div>
</div>


<p>Within the first ten minutes, all the meeting rooms had been booked up with various meetings – everything from the minutiae of libsass to contributing to open source to motivation for making things. It was great seeing strangers come together to discuss these topics and try to figure out solutions or help each other out.</p>

<p>I recruited Smith and a couple of other people to help me with a project I&rsquo;ve been sitting on for a while. It&rsquo;s almost done and I&rsquo;ll be posting about it soon.</p>

<p>It was a great end to the conference, and really drove home one of the things that I believe sets the Sass community apart from most other tech communities I&rsquo;ve seen: the realisation that building a diverse and welcoming community is just as important as building the technology itself.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-30T11:36:49-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post has an awkward title. That&rsquo;s chiefly because the bars in New York are so numerous that I couldn&rsquo;t claim knowledge of even 0.1 percent. I couldn&rsquo;t even claim to have exhausted bars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a> (our current neighbourhood), or even the Ninth Avenue bit of Chelsea. In fact, a more accurate title for this post would be &ldquo;Bars Between 20th and 17th Streets on Ninth Avenue: A Small Sampling.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange coming from Prague, where we managed to check off almost all of the decent cocktail bars in the centre, to a city where we&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been trying out some of the recommended bars in the area. We haven&rsquo;t found a bar we&rsquo;re completely comfortable with – the nice mix of decent cocktails and relaxed atmosphere has eluded us so far in Chelsea.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tipsyparson.com/">Tipsy Parson</a> is a great restaurant as well as a pretty good cocktail bar. You know how often, a Southern-style restaurant can&rsquo;t beat the food you actually get in the South? Well, that&rsquo;s not the case here. I had fried catfish with gravy, and Hampton had shrimp and grits. Both were great – the catfish was crisp and the gravy wasn&rsquo;t too peppery (which happens a lot with Southern gravy).</p>

</div>


<p>Looking at the menu, we spotted the head chef&rsquo;s name: Ty-Lör Boring. That&rsquo;s quite an unusual na- wait, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/people/ty-lor-boring/bio"><em>that</em> Ty-Lör</a>, from Top Chef?! It was!</p>

<p>They also have seats at the bar. The cocktails are a little bit hit and miss. They&rsquo;re trying hard to be inventive, but a lot of them miss the mark. There was a ginger-based drink that was <em>way</em> too gingery, even for me. The Professor Plum was pretty good, although due to seasonal changes of the menu I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s available any more.</p>

</div>


<p><a href="http://bathtubginnyc.com/">Bathtub Gin</a> is a speakeasy behind a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s quite conspicuous for a speakeasy – walking past on a Saturday night you see a line of people outside an empty coffee bar. I&rsquo;m no fool! No coffee is that tasty. We booked for 6pm on a quiet night and even then the bouncer made us wait outside, despite it being empty when we were eventually let in.</p>

<p>The drinks were quite good. We started out with a Martini and a Blushing Lady #2.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Blushing Lady #2</div>
</div>


<p>The Blushing Lady #2 tasted like a sour grape candy. The Martini was OK. The secound round proved better – a Vesper and a Last Word.</p>

<p>They had some great small plates to share – the mushroom gnocchi was my favourite. The pork belly sliders were also super-tasty.</p>

</div>


<p>The staff were a little stand-offish, which I&rsquo;m getting tired of when it comes to fancy speakeasy-style bars. Bourbon &amp; Branch in SF has a similar problem. (<em>Update</em>: we went to the speakeasy <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk and Honey</a> and the staff there were delightful. The drinks were great too!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php">La Bottega</a> is in a crazy-looking hotel called the Maritime. Its windows are all circular, and it&rsquo;s sides are sloped inwards. The drinks there are OK, but not very well balanced. The Vesper tasted like pure vodka; the Manhattan was almost pure vermouth.</p>

<p>Some other bars we&rsquo;ve been to in the Chelsea area (but not on 9th) are <a href="http://www.theparknyc.com/">The Park</a>, on 10th avenue, and <a href="http://heartwoodnyc.com/">Heartwood</a>, on 8th.</p>

<p>The Park is in a beautiful converted parking garage, with an indoor &ldquo;garden&rdquo; area. The front bar was pretty crowded, so we sat in the garden area where – pro-tip – there&rsquo;s a secret back bar! We ordered drinks from both and the back bartender was way better. Plus there was no wait at the back bar.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hendrick&#8217;s Mash</div>
</div>


<p>Heartwood is on 8th Avenue, between 20th and 19th. I ordered a couple of drinks there and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy them – one was my fault, the other the bartender&rsquo;s. The menu had sections, one of which was classifed as &ldquo;Shrubs.&rdquo; Not being familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_(drink)">drink called a shrub</a>, I picked one with gin in it. Turns out, they really do put vinegar in them. It was surprising on first taste, then just became kinda throat-burning. I love vinegar, but drinking it is a little difficult. Anyway, I put that mistake down to me, and not the bar itself. However, I then ordered a Last Word and they missed out the lime. That makes it a little undrinkable – just sweet and herbal. My first drink was too acidic, my next not acidic enough. There&rsquo;s no pleasing me.</p>

<p>Anyway, SassConf has started and I&rsquo;ll no doubt be writing about that as the week goes on.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/25/airbnb-powers-out/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-25T09:20:36-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/25/airbnb-powers-out</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re in New York City! The Big Apple! The city that never sleeps! Etc. etc.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d booked a small but nicely-designed AirBnB in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a>. After a small mix-up with the address (turns out the listed address was one street off, for some reason), we arrived and settled in. It was a little dirty, and there were no towels, but a quick stop at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bed+Bath+%26+Beyond/@40.7406703,-73.9942279,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x89c25d0c60996adb:0x480c0d194112b5d3!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sbed+bath+and+beyond+nyc!3m1!1s0x0:0x231ff6a484b76185">Bed, Bath and Beyond</a> sorted our need for cleaning supplies and linen.</p>

<p>Our first morning, we woke up and ran some quick errands. When we came back, the power was off at the apartment. We texted the host, who said that she was at work and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sort anything out until after 4pm – in about 6 hours (!). So&hellip; we wandered over to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art">Whitney</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons">Jeff Koons</a> retrospective. I love the Whitney – give me their brutalist architecture over the Guggenheim any day. They&rsquo;re moving to a new building next year so I&rsquo;m glad I got to visit their current space one last time.</p>

<p>The Koons retrospective was great. I was only familiar with a few of his works, and the exhibition did a great job of fleshing out the rest. The Equillibrium stuff was mesmerising. Definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re around (it&rsquo;s on until the 19th October, I think) – and grab the free audioguide too!</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Selfie in a Koons balloon</div>
</div>


<p>Still having a few hours to kill, we went to see a film. There&rsquo;s not a whole lot on right now (I&rsquo;m waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Girl_(film)">Gone Girl</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)">Inherent Vice</a> this autumn), so we took a chance on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drop_(film)">The Drop</a> with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and James Gandolfini. It&rsquo;s a slow-burning crime character study, although it&rsquo;s quite difficult to categorise. Tom Hardy does a great job of making a meek, loveable – but potentially dangerous – guy. It was also nice (but sad) to see James Gandolfini in what is his last feature-film role.</p>

<p>The film finished and we headed back to the apartment – the electricity was still off. We tried contacting our host, who told us that she&rsquo;d forgotten to pay the electricity bill for the past couple of months. Not only that, but everyone had gone home for the day and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to turn the power on until tomorrow. Oh dear.</p>

<p>By this point, it was starting to get dark and our living area looked a little bit like this:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The sofa</div>
</div>


<p>We called AirBnB who, to their credit, had great customer support. They said they&rsquo;d comp us for a meal and a hotel for that night. They said if the power wasn&rsquo;t on tomorrow, they&rsquo;d help us find a new place in NYC.</p>

<p>They arranged everything and got us a room at a <a href="https://www.kimptonhotels.com/stay/eventi-hotel-chelsea-ny">nearby Kimpton</a>. So, we packed up our satchels for an overnight adventure. We stopped for a quick meal on the way, and arrived at about 10:30pm. The check-in desk told us they were all booked up, and only had one strange room left – a library with a veranda. They said we could look at the room first, but we decided to go with it. At this point, as long as we had power we didn&rsquo;t really mind.</p>

<p>We got to the room and it was more of a suite or event space. One half had a library.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/library.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/library.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Library</div>
</div>


<p>And the other half had a dining room.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Panorama of the library</div>
</div>


<p>The room was on the corner of the building and had a wrap-around balcony/veranda. From there you had a great view of the Empire State Building.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/veranda-view.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The view from the veranda</div>
</div>


<p>We were feeling pretty great about this room until&hellip; wait, where was the bed?</p>

<p>Turns out, they forgot to bring a bed into the room. We called down to the front desk and they promptly sent up a couple of guys to make up a sofa bed for us.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Our bed</div>
</div>


<p>It was pretty comfortable, for a sofa-bed. Anyway, to make up for the weird room and lack of a proper bed, they gave us some credit for room service. As we&rsquo;d already eaten, we used the credit on better things.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Better things = wine</div>
</div>


<p>The next morning we headed back to the apartment and the power was still off – however the host had arranged for the electricity company and the super to come and get it all sorted out.</p>

<p>Although it was a bit of a nightmare, this is the first bad experience with AirBnB we&rsquo;ve had in the five months we&rsquo;ve been travelling. The AirBnB customer support was great, and the host also said she&rsquo;d give us the previous night free. Still, it was a pretty stressful adventure.</p>
