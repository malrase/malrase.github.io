    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We made it to Toronto! But more on that later. What&rsquo;s more important is drinking unusual alcohol. While in Toronto, we&rsquo;ve been hanging out with two of our awesome friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/mferrier">Mike</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">Melissa</a>. Last year, they visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ</a>, and <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=6587">bought a bottle of North Korean brandy</a> known as Paekrosul.</p>

<p>Apparently its name translates as <a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/nieminen/chiew.html">&ldquo;Hundred-Years Liquour&rdquo;</a>, which is certainly promising.</p>

<p>The bottle was a little tatty, and it was stoppered with a plastic cork. Inside, there was a bit of sandy sediment. Feeling the risk of going blind was one worth taking, we opened the bottle and poured ourselves a (small) glass.</p>

</div>


<p>I thought it smelled a lot like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu">baiju</a>, a Chinese liquour that my Dad always gets as a business gift. Others described it as having more of a turpentine aroma.</p>

<p>Despite its nose-burning smell, it tasted fine. Harsh at first, it quickly becomes sweeter and it didn&rsquo;t have a burning aftertaste that you get with a lot of high-proof drinks. No one really wanted to drink much more than a sip, though. What do you do when you have alcohol that no one&rsquo;s going to drink neat? You make a cocktail of course!</p>

</div>


<p>Mike and Melissa have a well-stocked bar, so I had a lot of stuff to work with. But where to begin? I looked online for some brandy cocktails to see if I could modify them. One suggestion was the <a href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/mtropltn_cktl.htm">Metropolitan</a> – like a Manhattan but with brandy instead of whiskey. I used one part sweet vermouth to three parts paekrosul, plus some Angostura for good measure. It didn&rsquo;t taste that great, though. As the paekrosul was sweet already, the vermouth didn&rsquo;t contribute much. Plus the main off-putting thing about paekrosul was the smell. Neither the vermouth nor the bitters covered that up. Time to try a different route.</p>

<p>My favourite cocktails are all citrus-based. Citrus fruits also tend to have pretty strong aromas, so I thought using lemon or lime might be good.</p>

</div>


<p>I mixed in some lemon juice and it tasted pretty good. It tasted even better if you used a lemon peel as a garnish. Twisting the peel to spray the citrus oil over the drink covered up the turpentine smell pretty well.</p>

<p>I tried it with lime but it didn&rsquo;t work as well – the lime flavour wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p>

<p>I also ended up adding some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointreau">Cointreau triple sec</a> to the mix to add a little more citrus and sweetness.</p>

</div>


<p>Ta-da! It wasn&rsquo;t the best cocktail I&rsquo;ve ever made, but I think I did a good job of mostly masking the worst flavours of the paekrosul while keeping its more distinctive flavours. I&rsquo;m pretty sure by next summer it will be on every speakeasy menu from Brooklyn to the Mission.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t come up with a witty name yet, so suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>The recipe, if you want to make this at home (!), is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 parts Paekrosul</li>
<li>1 part Triple Sec</li>
<li>1 part lemon juice</li>
<li>Stir over ice, serve with an ice cube and lemon peel garnish.</li>
</ul>
