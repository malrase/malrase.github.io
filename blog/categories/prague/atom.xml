    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josefov">Jewish Quarter</a> (or Josefov) of Prague is in the Old Town, just north of the Old Town Square. We&rsquo;d been told that the <a href="http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/apinkas.htm">Pinkas Synagogue</a> was a must-see, so we set off on a visit without learning much about it. All I knew was that it&rsquo;s now a memorial to victims of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">Holocaust</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>We arrived at lunchtime and the queue was really long and slow-moving. Not good.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-queue.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-queue.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Much queue wow</div>
</div>


<p>However! We found an EXPERT WORK-AROUND for buying tickets without having to wait in line. Head slightly east on the same road and take the first left. You&rsquo;ll find <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maiselova+38%2F15,+110+00+Praha-Praha+1,+Czech+Republic/@50.089592,14.4181715,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b94e8669ff2a5:0xb73abb80fc435169">a ticketing office</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ticket-office.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ticket-office.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Just around the corner – under 2 mins walk.</div>
</div>


<p>There was no queue and we got our tickets immediately. You can&rsquo;t buy a single ticket to see the synagogues/museums of Josefov individually – you have to buy a multi-attraction ticket. The most basic ticket was 300Kč (~$15) for four attractions: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_Cemetery,_Prague">Old Jewish Cemetery</a>, the <a href="http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/aklaus.htm">Klausen Synagogue</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Ceremonial_Hall,_Prague">Ceremonial Hall</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Synagogue_(Prague)">Spanish Synagogue</a>. You could pay 100Kč more if you wanted to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_New_Synagogue,_Prague">Old New Synagogue</a>, but we gave that one a miss. The ticket is valid over seven days, though, which is good if you don&rsquo;t have enough time to visit all the places in one day.</p>

<p>After we bought our tickets we went back to the Pinkas Synagogue and sailed past the line there to buy tickets.</p>

<p>The inside of the Pinkas Synagogue serves as a memorial to the 80,000 Bohemian and Moravian Jews that were victims of the Holocaust.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-room.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-room.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Inside the synagogue</div>
</div>


<p>There were about five rooms like the one above – and see those red and black, floor-to-ceiling patches that line the walls? Those are the victims' names, birth-dates and death-dates. Across the rooms they&rsquo;re written out like that, in letters maybe a centimetre high.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-names.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/pinkas-names.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Names, births and deaths of victims</div>
</div>


<p>At first, you don&rsquo;t quite understand it. Then as you start reading, seeing the families grouped together, it&rsquo;s a little overwhelming. Especially when you see room after room of them. It was powerful stuff, and something I&rsquo;d recommend everyone do while they&rsquo;re in Prague.</p>

<p>After exiting the synagogue, you walk through the Old Jewish Cemetery. While not that large geographically, it apparently contains over 12,000 tombstones.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/cemetery.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Old Jewish Cemetery</div>
</div>


<p>Needless to say, it was crowded with graves. The tombstones stuck out at all kinds of angles, and many were only just sticking out of the soil.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/cemetery2.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Another view of the cemetery</div>
</div>


<p>The cemetary exit leaves you just outside of Ceremonial Hall and the Klausen Synagogue. As we already had the multi-ticket, we decided to give them a visit.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ceremonial-hall.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ceremonial-hall.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ceremonial Hall outside</div>
</div>




<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/ceremonial-hall-floor.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ceremonial Hall tiled floor</div>
</div>


<p>The Ceremonial Hall used to be a kind of mortuary, so had a bunch of exhibits on the rituals surrounding death in Judaism. It was kind of interesting, but mostly just items in display cases.</p>

<p>The Klausen Synagogue was similar. Apart from the Pinkas Synagogue earlier on, I&rsquo;d never been inside a synagogue before. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I was expecting from the inside of a synagogue, but I was kind of disappointed that it looked just like a Christian church.</p>

<p>Inside the main area of the Klausen Synagogue, there were display cases showing items relating to Judaism. I found it a little strange. I almost wanted the museum part and the religious-building part to be more separate. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to be so much of a museum.</p>

<p>After leaving the Klausen Synagogue, the route to the next stop on our ticket took us past the Old New Synagogue. I only learnt afterwards that it&rsquo;s Europe&rsquo;s oldest active synagogue. Apparently, its attic is also the storage place for the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague">Golem of Prague</a> (<em>spooky noises</em>).</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Old New Synagogue</div>
</div>


<p>We continued walking, made a couple of quick turns, and found ourselves at the Spanish Synagogue. Not much to look at from the outside, inside it&rsquo;s absolutely stunning.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Spanish Synagogue interior</div>
</div>


<p>The walls are covered in intricate patterns, mostly using reds and golds. The Star of David appears in motifs everywhere, and I spent ages just following the patterns and their interplay across the walls. The central dome is beautiful and has a Star of David-shaped chandelier in the centre.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish-dome.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/josefov/spanish-dome.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Dome of the Spanish Synagogue</div>
</div>


<p>Fun fact: it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be clear why it&rsquo;s called the Spanish Synagogue. One theory is that the interior design reminded people of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain">&ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo;</a> of Judaism in Spain. Another theory is that it used to be a location for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaniotes">Byzantine Jewish</a> worship, and that led to legends of the Iberian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> once worshipping there.</p>

<p>Like the Klausen Synagogue, the Spanish Synagogue is a museum as well as a religious building. I was mostly distracted by the detailing on the walls, but I did look at a couple of the display cases in the upper balconies. They were pretty interesting, detailing the history of Josefov across the centuries. If it hadn&rsquo;t been over 30ºC in there, I would have stayed longer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad we ended up seeing more of the Jewish Quarter than just the Pinkas Synagogue, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d see the Klausen Synagogu and the Ceremonial Hall if I were pushed for time. I definitely found it more rewarding than most of Prague Castle, though.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.orangebar.cz/en/homepage.html"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Orange Bar</span></a> is pretty close by to us and has decent reviews. It's a little tricky to find, down a couple of side-streets, but there's a nice orange-shaped sign outside to let you know when you're there.</p>

  <div class="img">

  </div>

  <p>From the outside, it looks pretty normal, right? Inside, though, it reminded me of a bar in Dune or something. The only lights had orange filters, and all the walls were molded to give the appearance of being dug out of a cave.</p>

  <div class="img">

  <p>The bar shelves were all integrated into the back wall. The other walls had fake columns with cubbies for desert plants.</p>

  <p>The cocktail list leaned heavily towards rum-based beach drinks – mai tais, piña coladas, zombies etc. There's also a good list of classics, too. Hampton went for (of course) a manhattan. I tried out the mai tai but it was a little too sweet for me.</p>

  <p>We were there during a massive thunderstorm and didn't have umbrellas, so we stayed for another round (or two). The moscow mule was <em>much</em> better. Get that! It had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis_peruviana">physalis</a> garnish too, which is awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>For some reason, there's a bar in Prague named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>, the American union leader who went missing in the 70s. Unfortunately, my lack of Czech skills (and poor Google translating) don't help much with the "About" page on the <a href="http://hoffa.cz"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hoffa</span></a> website.</p>

  <p>First and foremost: this is a non-smoking bar! Yay! That automatically gets you points in my book. Most bars have smoking and non-smoking areas, but that's not quite the same. Location-wise, it's on a little intersection near the main train station (so great for people-watching), and has big windows. The decor is neat – they have a massive trompe-l'œil mural on one side so it looks like you're in a warehouse.</p>

    <div class="alt">The bar</div>

  <p>They have mostly traditional drinks, with some specials on a chalkboard. The drink I had was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I went for a glass of Pimm's as it was ridiculously hot outside.</p>

  <p>They offer decent bar snacks, too. We got some tortilla chips with salsa and sour cream.</p>

  <p>We also got some hamburgers, which were amazing. They were juicy, cooked medium-rare, and had spicy-sweet secret sauce on them. Delicious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>After the underwhelming experience at <a href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/19/cloud-9-prague">Cloud 9</a>, I wanted to try out the bar at the other Prague-based Hilton: <a href="http://www.hiltonpragueoldtown.com/loungebar-en.html"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Zinc Lounge and Bar</span></a>, found in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+Prague+Old+Town/@50.088515,14.431864,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x63a407a250359dc7">Hilton Prague Old Town</a>. I wanted to see how it measured up, and in short: it was pretty bad. Please forgive me, Cloud 9, I didn't realise your sister bar was so awful. I would have cut you some slack otherwise!</p>

  <p>The Hilton Prague Old Town is pretty easy to find compared with the other Hilton. It's just off Náměstí Republiky, one of the main squares in the Old Town. The Zinc Bar and Lounge is just to the right as you come in. "Zinc" is also the name of the hotel restaurant, just behind the bar</p>

  <p>Inside, it's decorated like a dreary hotel lobby. Leather seats and low, round wooden tables. Holey partitions of wood try to separate the actual hotel lobby from the bar. Despite their best efforts, we were still drinking around a bunch of people loudly chatting on Skype (I assume there's free wi-fi in the lobby area) and wheeling their luggage around, waiting for their ride to the airport.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/cocktails/zinc-bar.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Zinc Bar</div>
  </div>

  <p>The menu consisted almost entirely of classic cocktails. There was nothing inventive or fancy like at Cloud 9. We stuck to our staples and got a gimlet and a manhattan. They were both OK – competently done and similar to what you could find at a lot of bars in Prague.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/prague/cocktails/zinc-cocktails.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/cocktails/zinc-cocktails.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Drinks: gimlet and a manhattan</div>
  </div>

  <p>The thing is, these cocktails were 220Kč (~$11) each. And there was me going off on how expensive the Cloud 9 cocktails were, at 185Kč (~$9)! Like I said in the beginning, I'M SORRY CLOUD 9. The Cloud 9 cocktails were far more reasonably-priced (I still think they're expensive, though). At least you get something different, innovative. At Zinc you get a standard cocktail that at another bar (say, Groove Bar) would be 100Kč (~$5).</p>

    <div class="alt">Hampton looking SUPREMELY DISAPPOINTED</div>
  </div>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Put together the atmosphere of the hotel lobby with the fact that the drinks were exceedinly expensive for what they were, and you get a disappointing experience. I'd suggest venturing a little out of the hotel to find a better cocktail bar.</span></p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/19/cloud-9-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p><a href="http://www.cloud9.cz/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Cloud 9</span></a> (or, in full, Cloud 9 Sky Bar & Lounge) is located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?safe=off&ie=UTF-8&fb=1&cid=4324379790027078551&q=Hilton+Prague+Hotel&ei=BVnGU-X9E-aV7Ab6loCQDQ&ved=0CMQBEPwSMAo">Hilton</a>, just east of the central Old Town district of Prague. It's got pretty good reviews, most extolling the views over Prague. So, of course we had to go.</p>

  <p>Firstly: getting to the Hilton is surprisingly tricky. (<strong>NB</strong>: there are two Hiltons in Prague, the more central <a href="http://d1pa4et5htdsls.cloudfront.net/images/vfml/1/1/2/9/6/1/5/709926e0_prgothi_74095_s-original.jpg">Hilton Prague Old Town</a> and the <a href="http://www.hotels-in-czech.com/clfiles/photos/big/29-hilton-budova.jpg">Hilton Prague</a>. This is in the latter.) It's strange how much Prague changes between the first and eighth districts. It quickly goes from windy cobblestone streets to broad roads and unfriendly pedestrian crossings. The Hilton itself takes up a whole square block, yet finding the right route to get there – even finding the right entrance to use – was confusing. We just about managed by following the tourists forming a trail on their way to the Old Town.</p>

  <p>Once you've found your way in (use the west entrance to the Hilton, and take a sharp right for the lift to the ninth floor), the views are the first thing that strike you. It was early evening as we came in, and the sun slowly setting gave some nice cloud patterns. However, I guess I was expecting more of a grand view of the <em>centre</em> of Prague. Instead, you get a beautiful view of the Allianz building next door.</p>

  <div class="img">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">The view west, towards the centre of Prague</div>
  </div>

  <p>I suppose I'm being a little harsh – you can just see the top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Our_Lady_before_T%C3%BDn">Church of Our Lady before Týn</a> on the left. </p>

    </a>
    <div class="alt">I found <span class="strike">Wally</span> the Church!</div>
  </div>

  <p>The north and east views are nicer – but more pastoral than the gothic spires I was imagining.</p>

  <p>The bar itself was decorated like a hotel bar. Clean lines, mirrors everywhere, leather-backed chairs. They had a couple of outside seating areas, but these were filled up with hotel guests.</p>

  <p>Speaking of the clientele, I wasn't too surprised to find it filled with tourists. It was early (7pm), the bar is tricky to find, and it's a <em>hotel bar</em>, so you're not going to get an authentic Czech experience. Even so, the groups of English/North American tourists asking the waitress to pronounce "Na zdraví!" ("Cheers!") over and over was grating. But onto the cocktails!</p>

  <p>The menu was interesting, and had a good mix of classics plus some that had been made up in the bar. Their inventions all had new-agey, etherial names like SUNSHINE and MYSTIC and DESIRE. Their most famous cocktail (according to them, at least) is the CHARISMA.</p>

  <p>The Charisma is so famous that it has intricate instructions for drinking.</p>

  <p>Despite that, you still look like a wally drinking something with a giant chili pepper sticking out of it.</p>

  <p>My drinks weren't nearly as exciting. They didn't even have instructions on how to drink them. Sad times.</p>

  <p>The Mystic was a vodka-ginger-lime-sugar thing and was delicious. The Desire, on the other hand, tasted like what I imagine pot pourri tastes like (i.e. gross).</p>

  <p>The bar snacks were delicious. We never really found out what they were, due to the language barrier, but it seemed to be some kind of caramel-coated peanut in a crispy shell dusted in salt and dried tomato (? maybe). We scarfed them down in about five minutes.</p>

  <p>The prices were pretty crazy. I'm not sure if it's because it's in a hotel or because it has views (probably a little of both), it ran to about 185Kč (~$9) a drink. That may not sound like much, but they were easily the priciest cocktails we've had in Prague and the previous holder of that title was around 145Kč (~$7).</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">For a hotel bar, Cloud 9 is pretty decent. You have good views of Prague and some tasty cocktails. The hassle of finding it plus the prices mean it's not really worthwhile to go unless you're staying at the Hilton.</span></p>
