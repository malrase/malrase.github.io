    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our best friends, Mike and Melissa, decided to take a holiday to Europe. As this is on our doorstep, we tagged along. The vacation started in Zürich for four days, then moved to Paris for another four days.</p>

<p>It all started with a two-hour flight from the abysmal &ldquo;London&rdquo; Luton Airport, which brought us to ZRH. We arrived at 17:30 and got a brief train to the central station. Walking outside, we could easily see the architectural monstrosity that was the Marriott Zürich &ndash; our hotel for four days. The <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/zrhdt-zurich-marriott-hotel/">Marriott</a> was far enough out of town to make it a nuisance to get to. It was a 15-minute walk to our friends' hotel, the much more conveniently-located <a href="http://www.hotel-adler.ch/">Hotel Adler</a> on Niederdorfstrasse.</p>

<p>First thing&rsquo;s first &ndash; Zürich is very expensive. As I&rsquo;m writing this, the Swiss Franc is particularly strong against the USD, the Euro and the GBP. Beers cost 5F on average, and cocktails are easily 17F. Even a gin and tonic at <a href="http://www.spottedbylocals.com/zurich/kontiki-pub/">Kon-Tiki</a> was 13F. Very slimming for the wallet.</p>

<p>Secondly, Zürich was pretty chilly. I thought I&rsquo;d put my scarf away for the spring, but I had to bring it back out for this leg of the trip. (Although Mike and Melissa, hailing from Toronto, said it was about the same temperature as there&hellip;)</p>

<p>We tried to eat fairly traditionally. We ate at a couple of &ldquo;bierhalles&rdquo; &ndash; bench-style seating with various schnitzels and wursts on offer. The <a href="http://www.trymarket.ch/zeughauskeller/index.htm">Zeughauskeller</a>, at the southern end of Banhofstrasse, was very good. I wanted to take home vats of their potato salad.</p>

<p>We (of course) also ate at a fondue restaurant (underneath Hotel Adler, the <a href="http://www.hotel-adler.ch/restaurant-swiss-chuchi/">Chuchi</a>). Fondue is difficult to get wrong, really. Melt some cheese, add some alcohol and boom goes the dynamite. We ordered a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and a &ldquo;speciality&rdquo; pot, and found we were evenly split as to which we thought was the best.</p>

<p>On our first night (Melissa&rsquo;s birthday), we ate at <a href="http://www.hiltl.ch/">Hiltl</a>, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Europe. It was pretty good &ndash; I had some amazing fried tofu, and stole some of Hampton&rsquo;s truffle risotto. Nom nom, indeed.</p>

Activity-wise, I think there&rsquo;s a fair amount to do in Zürich. However, we didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot. We went on a boat-tour of the lake and river, which was pleasant (especially in the gorgeous sunshine we received). We also went to the <a href="http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/">Museum für Gestaltung Zürich</a> (a design museum), which was neat. It had a cool exhibition on the visual use of text, with a few music videos (including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J4O2-nsFBA">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a> by Dylan) and opening titles to movies (e.g. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZK7mJoPLY">Se7en</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqIclb4qsJI">Panic Room</a>).</p>

<p>We mainly went to cafes (for example, the <a href="http://www.odeon.ch/">Cafe Odeon</a> &ndash; frequented by Lenin and Tchaikovsky, apparently) and bars (for example, <a href="http://www.wings-lounge.ch/">Wings</a>, an airline-themed bar). It was fun, though. Last time we went (February 2010), we coupled the trip with some skiing &ndash; which was a lot of fun, too.</p>

<p>So, all in all, it was a good holiday. The second leg, Paris, is up next.</p>
