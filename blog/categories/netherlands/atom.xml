    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We toured the four main museums in Amsterdam: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank_House">Anne Frank House</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a>. For the first three Hampton&rsquo;s Dad bought tickets beforehand – which I&rsquo;d highly recommend doing as the lines looked hellish. For the last one, Hampton and I rolled up at 4pm on a Sunday (with closing time at 6pm) and waltzed right in.</p>

<p>The Rijksmuseum has recently undergone a huge rennovation, re-opening in April 2013. It certainly shows – the internal atrium is beautiful and the layout is intuitive. <strong>Pro-tip</strong>: don&rsquo;t pay €5 for the museum audio guide! The museum has a free app for iPhone/iPod – with all the same information on it. Use that instead! They even have free wi-fi in the museum if you forget to download it before you get there.</p>

</div>


<p>The app offers a 90-minute &ldquo;highlights&rdquo; tour, which we did. I could have spent more time in the Dutch masters area (on the second floor) – the highlights tour only looked at a couple of paintings there. The impressionist and romantic areas were a little less exciting.</p>

<p>The museum itself is <em>packed</em>. Admittedly, we are in the middle of tourist season, but I expected it to be slightly quieter on a Monday. It was difficult to get a peaceful moment with any painting – but I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when a museum is closed for a while and it&rsquo;s also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_art_museums_in_the_world">19th most visited museum in the world</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of super-famous paintings on the tour, the most famous being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch">Night Watch</a> by Rembrandt. Of course, it was in an insanely-crowded room. It was pretty easy to get close, though.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Who watches the Night Watch?</div>
</div>


<p>The information cards they had were really useful. They circle particular elements of the painting, drawing out background figures or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch#Acts_of_vandalism">where someone slashed the painting</a>.</p>

<p>I also really liked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milkmaid_(Vermeer)">The Milkmaid</a> by Vermeer. I could have spent a while looking at that painting. The rest of the museum was a little repetetive, especially the ground floor, which had a lot of medieval carvings.</p>

</div>


<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> was quite different from what I was expecting. There was a heavy emphasis on his development as an artist and his interaction with contemporaries.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/amsterdam/van-gogh-museum.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/van-gogh-museum.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The Van Gogh Museum</div>
</div>


<p>I was prepared to see gallery after gallery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)">sunflowers</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)">olive trees</a>, but in fact there was a lot more range in his style than I had previously thought. There were a number of Japanese-influenced paintings which had some aspect of the Van Gogh style I knew, but in a completely different context. There were also a lot of muted paintings, absent of his usually vivid palette – one of a bird&rsquo;s nest in particular stood out.</p>

<p>Being fans of contemporary art, it&rsquo;s probably no surprise that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a> was our favourite. The building has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam#mediaviewer/File:Stedelijk_Museum_1.jpg">giant bathtub-shaped</a> entrance, which is awesome. All the walls inside are painted white, and going from the ground floor to the first floor is a mesmerising experience – there&rsquo;s neon art all around the upstairs atrium, so you walk into a glowing otherworld.</p>

  <div class="alt">Going up to the first floor</div>
</div>


<p>On some of the columns downstairs, there&rsquo;s a cool set of porcelain plates by John Knight. They&rsquo;re from the Autotypes series. Each one has a blueprint of an extension to a city&rsquo;s modern art museum. They reduce the buildings to nothing but floor plans, and we both loved them. I want some for our house.</p>

<p>Downstairs traces modern art from 1900-1950, whereas upstairs does 1950-present day. The art is mostly displayed chronologically, and they had some great unfamiliar pieces by famous artists. I love seeing new works by great artists (maybe that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;greatest hits&rdquo; style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art">MoMA</a>?).</p>

  <div class="alt">Stunning and bold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein</a></div>
</div>


<p>As well as contemporary art, there was a large section of the museum devoted to design. There were lots of fun household items from the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

</div>


<p>There was also <a href="http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/the-gijsemmy-spectacle">a special exhibition/retrospective on Gijs+Emmy</a>, a couple who revolutionised jewelry in the 1960s. One of their first exhibitions was in the museum, and it was neat seeing videos of their models back then. Their necklaces were more like cowls than dainty chains, obscuring most of the model&rsquo;s face.</p>

</div>


<p>The museum had a lot of works that seemed to be crafted for them specifically. It was nice catching glimpses of how the museum itself had fitted into the history of modern art – a self-awareness that&rsquo;s lacking in a lot of museums.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was always a little ashamed that I&rsquo;d never visited Amsterdam. It&rsquo;s only a short flight from London and people always list it as a highlight of Europe. Hampton&rsquo;s parents were in Amsterdam for a week, so we decided to join them and find out what all the fuss was about.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>In a lot of ways, Amsterdam was exactly what I was expecting. Canals criss-crossed with beautiful bridges, cyclists going far too fast.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton and his Dad as we wandered around the canals</div>
</div>


<p>We decided to do a walking tour on foot. We stayed near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidseplein">Leidseplein</a>, and walking all the way to the center took about 40 minutes. We walked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_Square">Dam Square</a>, the centre of the city. It was nice, but touristy. You had to pay to go in the church or the palace, and we skipped both of them.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/dam-palace.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Royal Palace in Dam</div>
</div>


<p>What I would recommend is taking a canal boat around the city. We used the <a href="https://www.canal.nl/en/canal-bus">Canal Bus</a>, which is advertised as a hop-on/hop-off tour. However we just used it to see the city from another angle.</p>

<p>It stopped at most of the standard things – Dam Square, the Anne Frank House, Rembrandt&rsquo;s House, etc. – but it was nice to see some other bits of the city. In particular, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EYE_Film_Institute_Netherlands">Eye Film Institute</a> had a beautiful building.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/amsterdam/eyefilm.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/amsterdam/eyefilm.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Eye Film Institute</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(Amsterdam)">IJ</a> (the main waterfront of Amsterdam) from most of the city, and it&rsquo;s something we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen by just walking.</p>

<p>Another pro-tip: walk around at dusk. Especially in the summer, it&rsquo;s so relaxed and the houses look inviting. There are often people having parties on boats and people dining along the canals.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Dusk over houses</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a lot more to the city than hookers and weed (although you can find those in certain areas if you must).</p>
