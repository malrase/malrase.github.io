    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re about to head back to North America. That&rsquo;s right, the European leg of our 2014 journey is almost over. In a lot of ways, I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving. I feel a little short-changed – we only had <em>one day</em> in Vienna? Why didn&rsquo;t we make it to Budapest? Should we have spent time in a random British city, too?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the next leg of our trip: the East Coast. I&rsquo;m excited to learn more about Toronto and New York. I can&rsquo;t wait to drive down the East Coast as autumn descends and the leaves change. I&rsquo;m looking foward to using a more familiar currency, and for things to be not so expensive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking ahead to being back in San Francisco – being <em>home</em>. Travel is a lot of fun, and we&rsquo;re extremely aware of how lucky we are to be doing it, but it&rsquo;s quite exhausting and has a lot of anxiety associated with it. I&rsquo;ll probably write another post about that, though.</p>

<p>But now, we&rsquo;re at a half-way point in our travels. It&rsquo;s not literally a half-way point – we&rsquo;ve spent more time in Europe than we will on the East Coast – but it&rsquo;s close enough and is, if anything, almost a thematic half-way point. So I decided to do a bit of reflection on the packing aspect of travelling – whether I&rsquo;m regretting bringing that electric toothbrush, or how I feel about living out of a carry-on bag.</p>

<h3>Living from a carry-on</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad, to be honest. I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of the clothes I have, and some of them are a little bit worse-for-wear, but all in all it&rsquo;s fine. So far I&rsquo;ve not had the Fight Club-esque &ldquo;I want to get rid of more stuff&rdquo; epiphany, but I have thought about slimming down on some clothes at home, and definitely getting rid of some of our stuff in storage (do we <em>really</em> need all those wires?).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny that we&rsquo;ve been checking our bags for most of our European flights. It started because we were mainly flying with EasyJet, which has a strict one-bag-only policy. There was no way we could fit our laptop bags in our carry-ons, so we checked them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also been buying liquids in bigger quantities than we could take on the flight. Things like travel-sized shaving foam aren&rsquo;t always easy to come by, and it feels wasteful buying a whole can of foam just to throw it away after a couple of uses.</p>

<p>Having said that, using the carry-on as a &ldquo;way-of-mind,&rdquo; if you will, has been great. I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t pack a larger suitcase if I did this again. It&rsquo;s far more convenient to have a smaller bag when navigating small hotel rooms or getting on a train.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d brought</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things I wish I&rsquo;d brought – but to be honest, they&rsquo;ve been fairly easy to find abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Cups/re-useable bottle</strong> – in some AirBnB places we&rsquo;ve stayed in, they only had tiny water glasses. Most of the time, we&rsquo;ve ended up buying big bottles and refilling them. We bought two medium-sized plastic tumblers to take around in case we needed a mixed drink or something to pour into. They come in handy in hotel rooms, too!</p>

<p><strong>More bad shirts</strong> – I brought all my favourite shirts. Maybe this is just me, but I feel weird wearing my favourite stuff every day. They&rsquo;re already starting to get a little tatty. I wish I had some more simple shirts that I could easily throw away at the end of this trip.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d left</h3>

<p><strong>Some contact lenses</strong> – I really overpacked for contact lenses. I brought enough to wear every other day, and I&rsquo;ve barely used them. I guess I thought I&rsquo;d be wearing my sunglasses more often.</p>

<p><strong>Running shorts</strong> – yeah, that was wishful thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Three shirts</strong> – (a.k.a. dress shirts or button-downs) I just don&rsquo;t wear these as much as I thought I would. I brought one ironable shirt and two non. I just don&rsquo;t wear the ironable one because it&rsquo;s too much hassle. I think one shirt would be plenty.</p>

<p>Summer is wrapping up in Europe and I&rsquo;m starting to wear my heavier clothes again. But for a while, when it was 30ºC-plus every day in Prague, I cursed myself for bringing a woolen jumper and a heavy cardigan. Much like in a few months, I will probably be wondering why I brought shorts (although I did wear them a bunch!).</p>

<h3>Things I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> glad I brought</h3>

<p><strong>T-Mobile SIM card</strong> – I can&rsquo;t sing the praises of (the USA company) T-Mobile enough; we switched to them just before we left the USA.  They have unlimited 3G data and texts for a large number of countries, including every country we&rsquo;ve visited. Being able to use Google Maps, or check your e-mail, without having to worry about paying through the nose for every single megabyte is incredibly relieving.</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong> – this might be obvious for people who have and love their iPads. I was never that into my iPad, but waiting in airports, taking train journeys, and other such times have made be really appreciate it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/23/stockholm/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-23T13:55:14+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/23/stockholm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We spent a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and I really recommend checking the conference out. Although I&rsquo;ve been to Sweden once before, I&rsquo;ve never been to Stockholm so I was pretty excited to check out this new city.</p>

<p>Stereotypes about Sweden that are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s cold – it was summer but it was 18ºC most days</li>
<li>everything is expensive</li>
<li>people wear brightly-coloured trousers (was that just a stereotype I had?)</li>
</ul>


<p>I like Sweden a lot. It&rsquo;s far more multicultural than I first expected (I had images of streets and streets filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed Scandanavians). Stockholm isn&rsquo;t as tourist-y as the last few places we&rsquo;ve been, either. It was refreshing at dinner to hear people around you speaking Swedish rather than English.</p>

<p>We only really had time for one day of touring, and when Hampton and I tour a city, we take it seriously. We looked up the top three things to do in Stockholm and made it a priority to check them off.</p>

<p>Stockholm is built on a bunch of islands – an archipelago, really. The centralmost island is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan">Gamla Stan</a>, &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo;. It has winding cobbled streets and alleyways and it&rsquo;s also the home of the royal palace. That&rsquo;s where we started our walking tour.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton looking over Gamla Stan</div>
</div>


<p></p>

<p>It was pretty, but full of tourist shops. We quickly headed over to the neighbouring island to check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Museet">Moderna Museet</a>. Although not as big as, say, MoMA or the Tate Modern, the collection is really good. It&rsquo;s manageable in size but also offers a great narrative over 20th century art.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Calder sculptures outside the museum</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we island hopped again – this time taking a ferry to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_museum">Vasa Museum</a>. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund">theme park</a> on the island – but it wasn&rsquo;t open. Sad times!</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)">Vasa</a> was a ship built in 1620s in preparation for a war against Poland. On its maiden voyage, it sank about 20 minutes after setting sail. It lay in the Stockholm bay for over 300 years, until it was recovered in the 1960s. It&rsquo;s still undergoing restoration and preservation, and it&rsquo;s housed in its own museum.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the largest intact boats on display from the 1600s, and it&rsquo;s in great shape.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Intricate carvings on the back of the Vasa</div>
</div>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s some areas of slightly lighter wood on the image above (the post on the top-left, and the cherub mid-right). Those are where the original carvings fell off and they re-carved them from new wood. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think that the rest of the carvings remained like that from when they were made in 1628.</p>

<p>Finally we headed back to the city centre (just north of gamla stan) for some food. We ate at a great Scandinavian restaurant called <a href="http://www.rolfskok.se/?lang=en">Rolf&rsquo;s Kök</a>. I had a super-rich ox cheek dish, and Hampton had a creamy fish stew. Both were delicious!</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ox cheek</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we realised that there was a <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/mikkeller-stockholm/">Mikkeller Bar</a> nearby. A Mikkeller Bar recently opened in San Francisco, but we never went. Why not go now, when we&rsquo;re half-way around the world?! So we went. I had a tasty IPA. Hampton tried asking the bartender if they had a British-style ale, but got a sassy reply, so had some wine instead.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Viking 25 IPA</div>
</div>


<p>As if to remind me how silly it was going to a bar that&rsquo;s in my home city, they had the <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/01/13/mikkeller-introduces-mission-chinese-food-beer/">Mission Chinese</a> lager on the board, too.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mission Chinese beer</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we tried to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail. Pro-tip: don&rsquo;t try to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail in Stockholm. Cocktails are extremely expensive (think $20 up). We ended up in a hotel bar and got an overly-sweet Manhattan that barely covered the bottom of the glass it was served in.</p>

<p><em>Having said that</em>, we did get a list of cocktail bar recommendations from someone in Stockholm. We&rsquo;ll have to go back, if only to do a local&rsquo;s tour. Most of them seemed to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6dermalm">Södermalm</a>, which is apparently the hipster area of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Anyway, we had a lot of fun in the city and I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving so soon. Like Vienna, I want to make a point of visiting again, and staying longer next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a flight back to England, where we&rsquo;ll be spending the late August bank holiday weekend. After that, it&rsquo;s Paris for a week then back to the USA! It&rsquo;s strange how quickly this time has gone – it seems like no time has passed since we left San Francisco. However, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of travel left – our trip moving south along the East Coast.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/20/markhalle-neun-and-sage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a great indoor market called <a href="http://www.markthalleneun.de/">Markthalle Neun</a> that&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=10953314371184579858&amp;q=Markthalle+Neun+GmbH&amp;ei=3sHwU4q8BLDQ7Aa4tYDgCg&amp;ved=0CL0BEPwSMA4">a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying</a>. It&rsquo;s not a traditional market in that there are people selling stuff every day. On a normal day there&rsquo;s a handful of stands or mini-kitchens selling locally-made food, wine, and other stuff.</p>

<p>On Thursdays, however, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;street food&rdquo; gathering where a lot more people show up. All the booths are filled with people selling their food – everything from pancakes to samosas to steamed buns. There&rsquo;s also a couple of food trucks outside, too. It gets incredibly packed, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Street food Thursdays</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s also a Sunday morning &ldquo;breakfast market,&rdquo; which has more of a focus on breakfast foods.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been to a couple of these events, but mostly we go on weekdays for lunch. There&rsquo;s such a wide variety of food there it&rsquo;s difficult to go wrong. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve taken pictures of pretty much everything I&rsquo;ve eaten there, so this will mainly be a bunch of pictures of delicious food.</p>

<p>The best thing I&rsquo;ve had so far has been the barbeque from <a href="http://www.bigstuff.de/">Big Stuff Smoked BBQ</a>. It blew away most of the BBQ I&rsquo;ve had in the USA.</p>

<div class="img">

<p>There was a Vietnamese stall that did rice-stuffed rolls and some steamed buns.</p>

  <div class="alt">Delicious rolls with rice and meat inside</div>
</div>


<p>There was a great vegetarian burger place. We accidentally went there because it had the shortest queue. Then we found out it was vegetarian, almost left, but stuck with it. The burger was so good! I think it was tofu or something, but it was mainly tasty cause they slathered it in peanut sauce.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/berlin/food/mh9-veggie-burger.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/food/mh9-veggie-burger.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The best veggie-burger I've ever had</div>
</div>


<p>The next place I went to, I had their veggie-burger but it sucked, so I went back to eating all meat all the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m English so I love savoury pies. What luck! There was a pie place in the market. I got a cheese and mince one and it was SO GOOD. I would eat ten more right now.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Cheese and mince pie (note: not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie">that kind of mince pie</a>, which would probably be gross with cheese in it)</div>
</div>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t like pies (like Hampton), you can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">reuben sandwich</a>! It had pastrami on it. Apparently this guy from Portland moved to Berlin and was upset he couldn&rsquo;t get decent pastrami&hellip; so he opened a deli!</p>

  <div class="alt">Reuben sandwich</div>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fancy savoury items? Well there&rsquo;s a tonne of sweet stuff, too. There&rsquo;s a great waffle place.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/berlin/food/mh9-waffles.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/food/mh9-waffles.jpg">

  <div class="alt">Making waffles</div>
</div>


<p>Usually I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of waffles, but these were so good. Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Oh, and covered in caramel sauce.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">My waffle</div>

<p>The waffle place also did some crazy ice-creams&hellip;</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/berlin/food/mh9-icecream.jpg">

  <div class="alt">Raspberry and basil</div>

<p>And there was a lady selling ice-lollies (or &ldquo;popsicles&rdquo;).</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Buttermilk and lemon</div>
</div>


<p>OK, that&rsquo;s all my Markthalle photos. We did eat some fancy food as well – at <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a>. I really like the interior of this place. It&rsquo;s in a warehouse and has lots of industrial touches – like giant chains hanging from the ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also bright due to the large windows and white canvases on the walls.</p>

<p>We went for a four-course Chef&rsquo;s surprise menu. It was a great choice – full of interesting flavours and ingredients that I&rsquo;d never come across before. Here&rsquo;s some pictures:</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>It was super-tasty and you should definitely go if you&rsquo;re in the area. Get an apéritif on the beach beforehand!</p>

<p>Our time in Berlin is almost over, and next we&rsquo;ll be heading off to Stockholm for <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/17/drinking-around-kreuzberg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I say &ldquo;around Kreuzberg,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a little misleading as we haven&rsquo;t really managed to explore the whole area. Berlin is pretty massive – more like London than Paris or New York. It&rsquo;s not that easy to walk to other areas (although we did take a nice stroll over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a> a couple of times).</p>

<p>As you are probably aware, Hampton and I scouted out as many cocktail bars as we could as soon as we arrived. For the past two weeks, we&rsquo;ve been slowly venturing further from our apartment to test out other places. Here&rsquo;s our list (and <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zSa_dTkSRnX0.kH2Fqz02A-M4">a handy map</a>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why, but there&rsquo;s a cocktail bar named after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir">noted American environmentalist</a>: <a href="http://johnmuirberlin.com/">John Muir</a>. To be honest, I only knew about him because I&rsquo;ve made a couple of day trips up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muir_Woods_National_Monument">Muir Woods</a>.</p>

<p>The inside is all exposed brick, with a couple of naturalist touches (like some stuffed animals). It&rsquo;s nice and cosy (but the bathrooms are disco-themed??). They have a regularly-rotating drinks menu and their custom drinks are <em>really</em> good. I got the Lightning Bug, which was a citrus-gin thing with some other delicious extras (honey and lillet, I think?).</p>

<p>I tried a couple of other cocktails on offer, and they were also excellent. It was strange that it never seemed to get too busy. Most people ordered beer or wine, and I wanted to shout at them because the cocktails were so tasty. Overall: 8.0/10</p>

<p>Not far from John Muir is <a href="">Kirk Bar</a>. Again, not really sure why it&rsquo;s named that. Star Trek reference, maybe? Nerds.</p>

<p>The inside is pretty bad-ass. It has a real crumbling old-timey feel, with a patina most bars wish they could get. Beautiful cornicing and high ceilings. The first time we went, I was pretty drunk so I&rsquo;m not sure what I ordered. I think it was a gin sour – but I remember thinking it was good.</p>

<p>When we came back, I was more sober and remembered my drink order – a Hemingway sour. It was the same as a regular gin sour, but with grenadine added. (I thought Hemingway liked rum?)</p>

<p>Overall: 7.6/10</p>

<p>I talked briefly about <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a> <a href="/blog/2014/08/13/berlin-how-do-you-think-it-feels/">in my previous post</a> – it&rsquo;s the bar on the water. Well, there&rsquo;s also a restaurant in a warehouse building just inland from the beach area. I&rsquo;ll talk about the food in another post, but I had a pretty amazing cocktail there. It was called the London garden and looked like a juice drink I&rsquo;d find in San Francisco.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too sweet or too savoury, and it had the right amount of texture to it. It was so much more drinkable than those juices you find. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that it had alcohol in it or maybe it&rsquo;s&hellip; no, it was definitely the alcohol. Overall: 7.2/10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.homes-berlin.de/">Homes</a> was a little further away from our place, but we&rsquo;d read good reviews so we made the trek. It was decorated more like a casual coffee shop than a bar – it was very open, with low seating and &ldquo;cool&rdquo; murals on the walls.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a little unfair for me to be that dismissive – we were there pretty early for Berlin drinking time. Berlin is a very late city – people only consider going to a bar or club at midnight. I&rsquo;m happy to be in bed by then. It also means that bars are pretty empty around 7pm which means (yay) there&rsquo;s usually little wait but (boo) we&rsquo;re usually the only people in there.</p>

<p>Anyway, the drinks at Homes were passable. I got a gin-cacao-lillet thing that tasted way better than the ingredients list suggested.</p>

<p>I was a little underwhelmed. Overall: 6.5/10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yelp.de/biz/schwarze-traube-berlin">Schwarze Traube</a> (&ldquo;black grape&rdquo;) was our first cocktail bar when we arrived. It&rsquo;s less than a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying and it had really good reviews. I was pretty excited.</p>

<p>The door has a sign saying you have to &ldquo;knock and smile&rdquo; to enter, which I did. The bartender was <em>not</em> happy to see us. She kind of pointed at some seats before going back behind the bar. The place is pretty small – two or three tiny rooms. The decor is great, though, with lots of fraying antique chairs and side-tables.</p>

<p>The bartender came over and told us they had a gin-based special drink. I ordered that one, and Hampton ordered a manhattan (which elicited a big sigh from the bartender). I like the idea of a no-menu, bartender-curated drinks list but only if the bartender is nice. Anyway, the drinks came after about fifteen minutes (which was weird, as we were the only people in there). They were really bloody good, and served in equisite, delicate glassware.</p>

<p>After we&rsquo;d finished our drinks, we had to wait another twenty minutes of the bartender disappearing and/or ignoring our requests for the bill. Great cocktails, but not really worth the lacklustre service. Overall: 5.6</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/13/berlin-how-do-you-think-it-feels</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIofRTmTYVc">Title from Lou Reed&rsquo;s album, Berlin</a>)</p>

<p>Berlin doesn&rsquo;t feel European, and it&rsquo;s not quite like anywhere else Hampton and I have visited. It doesn&rsquo;t really seem to fit any classification, there&rsquo;s so much about it that&rsquo;s unique. I get that other cities have unique qualities. Paris has&hellip; <em>Parisian</em> things about it that make it unique – but it still feels European. Berlin does not. Maybe it&rsquo;s because  of its recent tumultuous history. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the idea of &ldquo;Europeanness&rdquo; includes Paris, and London, and Rome, but somehow left out Berlin. For whatever reason, it&rsquo;s an alluring city that we made a point of returning to.</p>

<p>Last time we visited Berlin, we stayed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenzlauer_Berg">Prenzlauer Berg</a>, a hip ex-East Berlin neighbourhood in the north of the city. This time, we chose to stay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a>.</p>

<p>Along with Prenzlauer Berg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a>, Kreuzberg is considered to be the trendier, less-polished side of the city. Although technically in West Berlin during the separation of Germany, Kreuzberg was on the eastern edge of the city, so was relatively underdeveloped. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, all three neighbourhoods have undergone varying levels of gentrification.</p>

<p>Coming from the obvious beauty of Prague or Amsterdam, Berlin was a little brutal. On our block, there are multiple featureless, indistinguishable mid-1970s apartment complexes. They&rsquo;re covered in graffiti and look pretty drab.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m probably not painting a great picture of Berlin, am I? The thing that really draws Hampton and me to the city is the people and the atmosphere. I&rsquo;d call it artistic or care-free; I&rsquo;m sure an American could equally describe it as entrepreneurial. Confused? Let me try and describe an example.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re staying just off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree">Spree</a>. It&rsquo;s a little industrial along our side of the river, with brick warehouses and lots of gates. We saw some place recommended on FourSquare along the river, but weren&rsquo;t that sure where it was. After walking through what looked like a gate to an industrial estate, we saw a couple of shipping containers stacked on top of each other with a 1970s car on top.</p>

</div>


<p>As you continue walking towards the bank of the river, you see a makeshift beach.</p>

  <div class="alt">Sage Bar – a beach</div>
</div>


<p>And there&rsquo;s this wonderful bar, hidden away, popular at all times of the day. Kids are running around playing in their sand as their tattooed, mid-thirties parents sip an Aperol and soda. There&rsquo;s grey-haired couples drinking tall beers, reading books. And right across the river is one of the longest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery">still-standing stretches of the Berlin Wall</a>.</p>

<p>Berlin is such a strange mixture of rule-following, energy, and laissez-faireness. People are frenetic and excited on the streets, playing loud music and drinking and rushing to the next bar&hellip; before languishing the next morning over a three-hour brunch. It takes a while to get used to, but it&rsquo;s something that I find very energising and disruptive.</p>

<p>One of the strangest moments so far was going for karaoke with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI">Travis CI</a> folks. The karaoke bar was just across the river from Kreuzberg, in Friedrichshain. To get there, we walked along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberbaum_Bridge">Oberbaum bridge</a>, which used to be an East-West border crossing.</p>

<p>We then walked past a stretch of the Berlin Wall, which was turned into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery">open-air gallery</a> soon after the unification of Germany.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The East Side Gallery</div>
</div>


<p>The gallery itself is really neat, and on a separate occasion we took a longer stroll along it.</p>

<p>Anyway, we got to karaoke, sang a few songs, drank a few beers. Then someone put on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_song)">&ldquo;Heroes&rdquo;</a> by David Bowie. Recorded in the 1970s in Berlin, it&rsquo;s about two lovers who can&rsquo;t be together: one is from East Berlin, and one is from West Berlin.</p>

<p>And there we were, singing about the horror of the wall, in a karaoke bar about 500ft away, having just crossed an ex-border crossing.</p>

<p>Above all, Berlin is wonderful and strange.</p>
