    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prague has excellent rail connections to many smaller cities and towns in the Czech Republic. Taking day (or weekend) trips, especially if you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for an extended time, is pretty easy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a> was our first destination.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cd.cz/en/">website for the Czech rail system</a> is great – it gave detailed times and information on the trains, all in English. From Prague, there were direct trains to Kutná Hora every two hours or so. As our timing didn&rsquo;t line up, we took a train to Kolín, then transferred. Pro tip: jot down the final destination of your planned train. It won&rsquo;t be Kutná Hora! We ended up just following the other tourists. The journey took about an hour total, and ended up at Kutná Hora hl. n., the main train station in the town. (The journey back was a bit worse, but more on that later.)</p>

<p>Kutná Hora hl. n is close (about a 10 minute walk) to the Sedlec end of the town. In Sedlec (a small suburb of Kutná Hora) are two famous sites: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlec_Ossuary">Sedlec Ossuary</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Assumption_of_Our_Lady_and_Saint_John_the_Baptist">Church of the Assumption of Our Lady</a>. I&rsquo;d heard of the Ossuary before, and that was the main reason we were in the town.</p>

<p>Getting to the ossuary was pretty simple – there were some signs pointing in the right direction (follow those labelled &ldquo;Kostnice&rdquo;). When you get to the ossuary, you can buy a ticket for up to four attractions: the ossuary and the Church of Our Lady (both in Sedlec), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Barbara%27s_Church,_Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Church of St Barbara</a> and the Jesuit College (in the Kutná Hora town centre). The Jesuit College was closed on Mondays so we didn&rsquo;t go. The admission was 160CK (~$8) for the three attractions.</p>

<p>The ossuary was neat. It was a lot smaller than I was expecting – basically one room, with a tonne of bones. It was creepy, but the number of tourists taking photos in there made it feel more like a room in the <a href="http://dedicatedtodlp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/potc-queue1.jpg">Pirates of the Caribbean queue</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>They hand out laminated sheets with some information on them, so you get a little historical information. However, I&rsquo;d recommend either loading up Wikipedia or having it on your phone for more detail.</p>

</div>


<p>After the ossuary, we went to the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. We were the only people in there. It was a little strange – I&rsquo;ve not really been in a Gothic-looking cathedral where all the walls are painted beige/yellow.</p>

</div>


<p>Aside from a couple of <a href="http://www.onestepinto.com/gallery/Kutna%20Hora/DSC_4303_Kutna_OSI.jpg">garishly-dressed relics</a> it was pretty dull. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend going but it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste as you walk right by it heading into town from the ossuary.</p>

<p>There are supposedly a number of buses that go from the ossuary into the centre, but we decided we&rsquo;d walk it. The best thing I can say about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sedlec+Ossuary,+Z%C3%A1meck%C3%A1,+284+03+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/St+Barbara's+Church,+Barborsk%C3%A1,+284+01+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/@49.9533462,15.2670308,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c40fc635ac54f:0x320cc9caa5f1508e!2m2!1d15.288043!2d49.961782!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c41a6cd710ae9:0xa19ced0f3eeca1db!2m2!1d15.26362!2d49.944911!3e2">the walk from Sedlec into Kutná Hora proper</a> is that it was about 40 minutes and got us a fair few steps on our fitbits. The walk is mainly through industrial and suburban parts of the town, and for the most part there&rsquo;s not much to look at. However, once you get into the centre itself, Kutná Hora is gorgeous.</p>

<p>There are a number of winding cobblestone back-streets with beautiful buildings. I think we could have spent a few hours just wandering around the town. We had a quick lunch at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274701-d1570760-Reviews-Restaurant_Cafe_Harmonia-Kutna_Hora_Central_Bohemian_Region_Bohemia.html">Café Harmonia</a>, which had amazing gnocchi. Then we headed for the next church on our list: St Barbara&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The walk up to the cathedral was beautiful – there&rsquo;s a promenade-type thing with statues along it that reminded us of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>From the promenade you get a great view looking over Kutná Hora.</p>

<p>Inside, St Barbara&rsquo;s was amazing. Much better than the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady.</p>

</div>


<p>There were a few stained glass windows from the 1910s, which were neat. The one which I found interesting was from 2013. I find modern stained glass intriguiging as it&rsquo;s not really a standard modern art form (aside from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_%26_George">Gilbert and George</a>).</p>

<p>After we had explored the cathedral, we started our journey back to Prague. Rather than walk the 40 minutes back to Kutná Hora hl. n., we went to the station in the centre of town – Kutná Hora město. It&rsquo;s tiny and rural, without any real platforms. There&rsquo;s a shuttle train that runs between this station and the main station. When we arrived, the next train was in 40 minutes(!), and we didn&rsquo;t have much choice but to wait for it. We changed at the main station to a train to Kolín. From Kolín to Prague we ended up on the Berlin train, an EC-class train. It was slightly nicer than the R-class we took on the way there, but not by much. It ended up taking us about two hours for the return journey. I&rsquo;d recommend timing your trip back carefully.</p>

<p>All in all it was a pretty nice day trip. If you&rsquo;re travelling around the Czech Republic, or you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for a while and want to get out of the city, it&rsquo;s a fun thing to do.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-01T14:43:53+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/01/prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many people say how much they like Prague. I&rsquo;ve also heard many people say how much charm Prague has lost since the mid-90s, how it&rsquo;s now filled with tourists. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to expect. Would it be inviting and elegant, or a tourist-trap nightmare?</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve been here for three weeks, and I can safely say we both love the city. We love it so much we&rsquo;re planning on extending our time here until the end of July. It&rsquo;s got a mix of many things we enjoy about other European cities: the architectural beauty of Paris, the efficient transit of Berlin, the edginess (and cheapness) of Gdańsk. Plus, as I <a href="/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague">mentioned previously</a>, it has great cocktails.</p>

<p>The first seven days we were here, four nights had fireworks displays. There was a <a href="http://unitedislands.cz/">free music festival</a> the other weekend. There was <a href="http://www.prazskamuzejninoc.cz/">Prague Museum Night</a>, where museums stayed open until late at night. There&rsquo;s usually an open-air concert on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/St%C5%99eleck%C3%BD+ostrov/@50.08048,14.410501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x20fab08b45c47614">this island in the Vltava</a>. It seems like there&rsquo;s always something happening, and I think that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons we&rsquo;ve been drawn to Prague as a livable city.</p>

<p>Having said all of that&hellip; there are a tonne of tourists in certain areas – and this is where I maybe see why some people say Prague has lost its charm. We are (thankfully) staying about 10 minutes' walk from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square_(Prague)">Old Town Square</a>. We can easily get there if we want to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Orloj">Astronomical Clock</a> chime, but we&rsquo;re not trapped by the tourists.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/oldtownsq.jpg">
  <div class="alt">All the tourists, ever</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s overwhelming, for sure. Cross into the Old Town and you pretty much hear only English being spoken. If you&rsquo;re thinking of staying in Prague, I&rsquo;d try and avoid that area if possible. The city is extremely walkable, so staying a little outside the centre shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. We&rsquo;re just south of Národní, which is perfect.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve jotted down some thoughts on the tourist-type stuff we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first thing we did, and the first thing I&rsquo;d suggest doing, is a self-guided walking tour. I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly impressed with the Rick Steves walking tours we&rsquo;ve done in previous cities, and his <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/eastern-europe">Prague city walk tour</a> was no different. The tour is available as a free podcast and takes about two or three hours. The recording itself is just over one hour, but we stopped in museums and cafés as we went.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/ourladyoftyn.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Listening to Rick in the Old Town Square</div>
</div>


<p>The tour covers a lot of the history of not just Prague, but the Czech Republic as a whole. I was completely ignorant of the recent history of the country and found the descriptions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Palach">Jan Palach&rsquo;s suicide</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution">Velvet Revolution</a> quite stirring. You end up seeing all the main sights of Prague, which is great to orientate yourself. You can then go back and check out places that you find interesting on a different day (or stop along the way, as we did).</p>

<p>Another pretty common tourist thing to visit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_castle">Prague Castle</a>, which you can see from most places in Prague. We decided to foolishly climb up. I would not recommend it – it&rsquo;s a pretty steep climb. Take transit there instead!</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/viewfromcastle.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Those are the steps we had to climb up</div>
</div>


<p>The castle itself is apparently one of the largest castle complexes in the world. It&rsquo;s the seat of the President of the Czech Republic and has a bunch of government offices too. It&rsquo;s pretty cool, but&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it if you&rsquo;re only here for a couple of days.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ticket options – one has four of the major sights, the other has all ten of them. We went for the four-sight option, which was plenty. The audioguides were all out of battery (?!) when we went on a Monday, so that meant we didn&rsquo;t get quite as much information out of our visit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vitus_Cathedral">St Vitus' Cathedral</a> was the highlight by a long shot. It had some gorgeous art nouveau stained glass windows.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/stvitusstainedglass.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Stained glass windows by Alphonse Mucha</div>
</div>


<p>The other attractions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Basilica,_Prague">St George&rsquo;s Basilica</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Royal_Palace_(Prague)">Old Royal Palace</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lane">Golden Lane</a>) were&hellip; not as impressive. The Basilica had some interesting old murals, the Old Royal Palace had the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations_of_Prague">defenestration</a> window. Golden Lane was just a bunch of tourist shops, so I&rsquo;m not sure why it was included as an &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; in the ticket price.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn">Petřín Hill</a> is another imposing feature on the Prague skyline. We took the funicular to the top, which Hampton enjoyed because he loves funiculars. Apart from that, there wasn&rsquo;t much up there. Looking at the hill, it&rsquo;s covered in trees. We didn&rsquo;t quite realise that that meant there&rsquo;d be no view from the top of the hill. All you can see from up there is forest, pretty much. You could pay 100K or so (~$5) to go up a replica of the Eiffel Tower, which I&rsquo;m sure had better views, but we decided to spend our money instead on an old mirror maze.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/houseofmirrors.jpg">
  <div class="alt">19th century mirror maze</div>
</div>


<p>The walk down is pleasant, so if it&rsquo;s a nice day I&rsquo;d recommend taking a trip.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all the tourist stuff we have done. Like I said, we&rsquo;ve mostly enjoyed the non-tourist stuff here. It&rsquo;s a great city to explore, especially with the number of parks for lazing and the random outdoor concerts we&rsquo;ve experienced. A great site we&rsquo;ve been using is <a href="http://www.expats.cz/">Expats.cz</a>, which has a list of events going on every day.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-20T11:38:18+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p>We've been in Prague for just over a quarter of our month-long stay. So far, it's treated us well. I'll write a longer post about thoughts on Prague (and the Czech Republic) later on, but first to more important things: cocktails.</p>

  <p>Due to other European cities lacking decent cocktail bars, we didn't have high hopes for Prague. Although we eventually found some in Paris, that was after a fair bit of research and travelling to the other side of the city. Would Prague be any different? Additionally, the first thing anyone says about the Czech Republic is that you'll never want for beer – it's cheap, good quality, and plentiful. Was there any room for a good whiskey sour?</p>

  <p>In short: yes. There are a surprising number of decent cocktail bars within five minutes' walk of our just-out-of-centre apartment. Most of them do standard cocktails as well as some of their own invention. So far, <a href="http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hemingway Bar</span></a> is probably my favourite.</p>

  <p>It's on one of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&cid=2095651347638903815&q=Hemingway+Bar&ei=cQSkU-TBPMrsO6zsgJAH&ved=0CKkBEPwSMA4">narrow winding streets of Old Town</a>, just off the river – so it makes for a nice walk, especially at dusk with the lights of the castle just coming on.</p>

    <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/castle_dusk.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Sunset over the Vltava</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bar itself is cosy, with three or four small rooms spread over two floors. Pictures of Hemingway line all the walls, as do various drinking vessels – most of which seem to be actually used for drinks.</p>

  <p>The best cocktail (and the one Hampton keeps going back to) is the Red Carpet. It's like an old fashioned/whiskey sour/manhattan mix-up. It's delicious and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Oh, and it comes served on a little square of red carpet. Cute.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/redcarpet.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Red Carpet</div>
  </div>

 <p> I had a gin-lillet cocktail that was also pretty refreshing (maybe it was just because it was 32ºC outside?). With a name like "Corpse Reviver," I thought I'd be getting something throat-burning, but it was really smooth.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/corpsereviver2.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Corpse Reviver Nº2</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next adorable drink: a martinez using Earl Grey-infused gin. It came in a teacup with a biscuit to nibble on. Perfect!</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/marteanez.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Mar-tea-nez</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hampton got the Nick Adams Penicilin, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Adams_(character)">a character in a number of Hemingway's short stories</a>. It came on a tray with a glass of ice, a small aspirin-shaped sweet, a bottle of lemon/honey/whisky, and an Erlenmeyer flask of 10-year malt whisky. We were instructed to pour the bottle over the ice, then float the 10-year malt over the top. It was fun! Also get the Hemingway's New Fashioned if you're into process-heavy drinks with multiple components.</p>

    <div class="alt">Nick Adams Penicillin (with everything poured)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Onto one strange thing that happened. Have you ever ordered an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Car_Bomb">Irish Car Bomb</a>? I'm assuming that most people reading this aren't frat boys, so I'm going to guess most said "no." Anyway, the first time I heard someone talk about it I was shocked. Needless to say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a> are a very recent, violent, and real part of my country's history. Having a drink named after such a thing is hideous and offensive.</p>

  <p>What's this rant got to do with the bar? Well, as part of Gin Fest, occuring this week in Prague, they had a special cocktail. It was called "The Bronx." I was recommended it by the bartender, so I got it. It came on a graffiti coaster and a pipette filled with a dark liquid. The bartender squirted the liquid on top of the drink and explained with a cheeky grin that it represented blood.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/thebronx.jpg">
    <div class="alt">The Bronx</div>
  </div>

  <p>Was this a drink facetiously referencing gang violence? The bartender seemed to think it was pretty clever. I was just bewildered. For what it's worth, though, it didn't taste bad.</p>

  <p>There were a number of other cocktails I didn't take photos of, but were delicious. Their Lavender Martini was great, and they had the first whiskey sour to rival my favourite (from the Dogpatch Saloon or 83 Proof in San Francisco). In fact, they have a fair few drinks on the menu with egg whites, which I'm a sucker for.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Hemingway is an inventive cocktail bar that wouldn't be out of place in any of the more "traditional" cocktail cities like San Francisco, New York or London.</span></p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p>We are in London for a few nights and squeezing in as many activities as possible. Obviously, a major focus of this was drinking. Finding cocktails here is pretty easy compared with continental Europe – within a few blocks of where we're staying there's <a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/">Happiness Forgets</a> and <a href="http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/">Callooh Callay</a>, both excellent cocktail bars. </p>

  <p>However, I was most excited about visiting <a href="http://barnightjar.com"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Nightjar</span></a>. We were recommended it by a friend in San Francisco. The menu online looked interesting, so I booked a table. There's no standing in the bar, and you have to have a table to get service. I booked about four days before, on a Tuesday, and could only get a table at 6pm.</p>

  <p>It's behind an unassuming door <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=nightjar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=3FyPU4TXOsXhPPGVgKAI&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw">just near Old Street underground station</a>. The bouncer checks your name against a list, and sends you downstairs. After being in the daylight, heading down a candle-lit staircase was a little disorienting. At the bottom of the stairs, the maitre d' (is that even what they're called in a cocktail bar?) welcomed us and sat us down at a small table next to a cabinet of old liqueuers.</p>

  <p>The menu had an incredible cover, with the Nightjar appearing on it multiple times. Throughout the night the silhouette of the bird was a recurring theme – punched into lemon-rinds or branded on the side of a mug.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The menu was extensive, sorted by pre-prohibition, prohibition, post-war and signature drinks. Most of the cocktails had at least one ingredient I'd never heard of. It took us a while to decide what to go for, but the bartender was helpful in pointing you towards certain things. With her help, I chose the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/new-orleans-daisy">New Orleans Daisy</a> as it had chartreuse in it – but the bartender suggested I take it with gin. Turns out it comes in an owl-shaped container with a candied hibiscus flower and a peacock feather.</p>

  <p>It was really quite incredible. It had an almost buttery flavour with a nectar aftertaste.</p>

  <p>Our friend went for the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/london-mule">London Mule</a>. The picture below doesn't quite convey the size of the mug: it was probably about 12 inches high. Most of that was packed ice. It was a great interpretation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mule">mule</a>-style of drink.</p>

  <p>Hampton got a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/toronto">Toronto</a>, which was similar to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned">Old Fashioned</a> but with maple syrup as the sweetener. Its garnish was a candy-floss nest with some mini-eggs in it.</p>

  <p>I noticed another table received a cocktail in some sort of two-neck condensing flask. I asked what it was, and it's called the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/foragers-shrub">Forager's Shrub</a>. Of course I went for that next.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The cocktail itself was in the bigger bulb. In the internal, smaller bulb was an oil with some dry ice (I think). It produced a vapour which I was instructed to smell. It smelt of pine and nettles, like a forest after some rain.</p>

    <div class="alt">Must-smell item</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bartender then poured the drink out – the fragrant oil into a chalice and the drink itself into a tumbler with ice. I was instructed to smell the oils before drinking. Sure, it was fairly pretentious but here's the thing – the smell really did make it taste different. And the cocktail was amazing, so I didn't care if I looked like a wally taking a big huff before every sip.</p>

  </div>

  <p>My last drink was a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/marmalade-no-2">Marmalade Nº 2</a>. It tasted exactly like a Seville orange marmalade – acidic, bitter, bursting with orange flavour. I loved it.</p>

  <p>Other drinks we had but I didn't take pictures of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/bloody-mary">Bloody Mary</a> – served in a hollowed-out squash (you can almost see it behind the Marmalade Nº 2 above)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/name-samurai">Name of the Samurai</a> - served in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake_set">ochoko</a> set inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masu_(Japanese)">masu</a> which had burnt herbs inside</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/secret-cocktail">Secret Cocktail</a> – a gin/egg white combination that was pretty tasty, but had icing sugar around the whole glass so was impossible to drink without getting sticky</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/deep-sea">Deep Sea</a> - had squid ink in it, and had nori around the rim of the glass</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/prairie-flip">Prarie Flip</a> – had a garnish of a boiled quail's egg and had a weird garlicky taste... not sure I'd recommend this one</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The cocktails weren't too expensive – between £8 and £12 was the average. Considering that such care went into not only the flavours, but also the decoration and presentation, I found it to be a worthwhile treat.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Nightjar serves innovative cocktails in both taste and presentation.</span> I can see Hampton and I coming back here whenever we're in London. </p>
