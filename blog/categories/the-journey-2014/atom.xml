    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p>We've been in Prague for just over a quarter of our month-long stay. So far, it's treated us well. I'll write a longer post about thoughts on Prague (and the Czech Republic) later on, but first to more important things: cocktails.</p>

  <p>Due to other European cities lacking decent cocktail bars, we didn't have high hopes for Prague. Although we eventually found some in Paris, that was after a fair bit of research and travelling to the other side of the city. Would Prague be any different? Additionally, the first thing anyone says about the Czech Republic is that you'll never want for beer – it's cheap, good quality, and plentiful. Was there any room for a good whiskey sour?</p>

  <p>In short: yes. There are a surprising number of decent cocktail bars within five minutes' walk of our just-out-of-centre apartment. Most of them do standard cocktails as well as some of their own invention. So far, <a href="http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hemingway Bar</span></a> is probably my favourite.</p>

  <p>It's on one of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&cid=2095651347638903815&q=Hemingway+Bar&ei=cQSkU-TBPMrsO6zsgJAH&ved=0CKkBEPwSMA4">narrow winding streets of Old Town</a>, just off the river – so it makes for a nice walk, especially at dusk with the lights of the castle just coming on.</p>

    <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/castle_dusk.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Sunset over the Vltava</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bar itself is cosy, with three or four small rooms spread over two floors. Pictures of Hemingway line all the walls, as do various drinking vessels – most of which seem to be actually used for drinks.</p>

  <p>The best cocktail (and the one Hampton keeps going back to) is the Red Carpet. It's like an old fashioned/whiskey sour/manhattan mix-up. It's delicious and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Oh, and it comes served on a little square of red carpet. Cute.</p>

    <div class="alt">Red Carpet</div>
  </div>

 <p> I had a gin-lillet cocktail that was also pretty refreshing (maybe it was just because it was 32ºC outside?). With a name like "Corpse Reviver," I thought I'd be getting something throat-burning, but it was really smooth.</p>

    <div class="alt">Corpse Reviver Nº2</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next adorable drink: a martinez using Earl Grey-infused gin. It came in a teacup with a biscuit to nibble on. Perfect!</p>

    <div class="alt">Mar-tea-nez</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hampton got the Nick Adams Penicilin, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Adams_(character)">a character in a number of Hemingway's short stories</a>. It came on a tray with a glass of ice, a small aspirin-shaped sweet, a bottle of lemon/honey/whisky, and an Erlenmeyer flask of 10-year malt whisky. We were instructed to pour the bottle over the ice, then float the 10-year malt over the top. It was fun! Also get the Hemingway's New Fashioned if you're into process-heavy drinks with multiple components.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Onto one strange thing that happened. Have you ever ordered an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Car_Bomb">Irish Car Bomb</a>? I'm assuming that most people reading this aren't frat boys, so I'm going to guess most said "no." Anyway, the first time I heard someone talk about it I was shocked. Needless to say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a> are a very recent, violent, and real part of my country's history. Having a drink named after such a thing is hideous and offensive.</p>

  <p>What's this rant got to do with the bar? Well, as part of Gin Fest, occuring this week in Prague, they had a special cocktail. It was called "The Bronx." I was recommended it by the bartender, so I got it. It came on a graffiti coaster and a pipette filled with a dark liquid. The bartender squirted the liquid on top of the drink and explained with a cheeky grin that it represented blood.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/thebronx.jpg">
    <div class="alt">The Bronx</div>
  </div>

  <p>Was this a drink facetiously referencing gang violence? The bartender seemed to think it was pretty clever. I was just bewildered. For what it's worth, though, it didn't taste bad.</p>

  <p>There were a number of other cocktails I didn't take photos of, but were delicious. Their Lavender Martini was great, and they had the first whiskey sour to rival my favourite (from the Dogpatch Saloon or 83 Proof in San Francisco). In fact, they have a fair few drinks on the menu with egg whites, which I'm a sucker for.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Hemingway is an inventive cocktail bar that wouldn't be out of place in any of the more "traditional" cocktail cities like San Francisco, New York or London.</span></p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-04T13:49:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p>We are in London for a few nights and squeezing in as many activities as possible. Obviously, a major focus of this was drinking. Finding cocktails here is pretty easy compared with continental Europe – within a few blocks of where we're staying there's <a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/">Happiness Forgets</a> and <a href="http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/">Callooh Callay</a>, both excellent cocktail bars. </p>

  <p>However, I was most excited about visiting <a href="http://barnightjar.com"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Nightjar</span></a>. We were recommended it by a friend in San Francisco. The menu online looked interesting, so I booked a table. There's no standing in the bar, and you have to have a table to get service. I booked about four days before, on a Tuesday, and could only get a table at 6pm.</p>

  <p>It's behind an unassuming door <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=nightjar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=3FyPU4TXOsXhPPGVgKAI&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw">just near Old Street underground station</a>. The bouncer checks your name against a list, and sends you downstairs. After being in the daylight, heading down a candle-lit staircase was a little disorienting. At the bottom of the stairs, the maitre d' (is that even what they're called in a cocktail bar?) welcomed us and sat us down at a small table next to a cabinet of old liqueuers.</p>


  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/mat.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Nightjar coaster</div>
  </div>

  <p>The menu had an incredible cover, with the Nightjar appearing on it multiple times. Throughout the night the silhouette of the bird was a recurring theme – punched into lemon-rinds or branded on the side of a mug.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/menu.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Menu</div>
  </div>

  <p>The menu was extensive, sorted by pre-prohibition, prohibition, post-war and signature drinks. Most of the cocktails had at least one ingredient I'd never heard of. It took us a while to decide what to go for, but the bartender was helpful in pointing you towards certain things. With her help, I chose the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/new-orleans-daisy">New Orleans Daisy</a> as it had chartreuse in it – but the bartender suggested I take it with gin. Turns out it comes in an owl-shaped container with a candied hibiscus flower and a peacock feather.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/new-orleans-daisy.jpg">
    <div class="alt">New Orleans Daisy</div>
  </div>

  <p>It was really quite incredible. It had an almost buttery flavour with a nectar aftertaste.</p>

  <p>Our friend went for the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/london-mule">London Mule</a>. The picture below doesn't quite convey the size of the mug: it was probably about 12 inches high. Most of that was packed ice. It was a great interpretation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mule">mule</a>-style of drink.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/london-mule.jpg">
    <div class="alt">London Mule</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hampton got a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/toronto">Toronto</a>, which was similar to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned">Old Fashioned</a> but with maple syrup as the sweetener. Its garnish was a candy-floss nest with some mini-eggs in it.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/toronto.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Toronto</div>
  </div>

  <p>I noticed another table received a cocktail in some sort of two-neck condensing flask. I asked what it was, and it's called the <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/foragers-shrub">Forager's Shrub</a>. Of course I went for that next.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/foragers-shrub1.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Forager's Shrub in flask</div>
  </div>

  <p>The cocktail itself was in the bigger bulb. In the internal, smaller bulb was an oil with some dry ice (I think). It produced a vapour which I was instructed to smell. It smelt of pine and nettles, like a forest after some rain.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/foragers-shrub2.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Must-smell item</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bartender then poured the drink out – the fragrant oil into a chalice and the drink itself into a tumbler with ice. I was instructed to smell the oils before drinking. Sure, it was fairly pretentious but here's the thing – the smell really did make it taste different. And the cocktail was amazing, so I didn't care if I looked like a wally taking a big huff before every sip.</p>

  <div class="img">

    <div class="alt">The final cocktail (yes that's a mini corn on the cob)</div>
  </div>

  <p>My last drink was a <a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/marmalade-no-2">Marmalade Nº 2</a>. It tasted exactly like a Seville orange marmalade – acidic, bitter, bursting with orange flavour. I loved it.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/london/nightjar/marmalade-2.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Marmalade Nº 2</div>
  </div>

  <p>Other drinks we had but I didn't take pictures of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/bloody-mary">Bloody Mary</a> – served in a hollowed-out squash (you can almost see it behind the Marmalade Nº 2 above)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/name-samurai">Name of the Samurai</a> - served in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake_set">ochoko</a> set inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masu_(Japanese)">masu</a> which had burnt herbs inside</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/secret-cocktail">Secret Cocktail</a> – a gin/egg white combination that was pretty tasty, but had icing sugar around the whole glass so was impossible to drink without getting sticky</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/deep-sea">Deep Sea</a> - had squid ink in it, and had nori around the rim of the glass</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.barnightjar.com/drinks/prairie-flip">Prarie Flip</a> – had a garnish of a boiled quail's egg and had a weird garlicky taste... not sure I'd recommend this one</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The cocktails weren't too expensive – between £8 and £12 was the average. Considering that such care went into not only the flavours, but also the decoration and presentation, I found it to be a worthwhile treat.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Nightjar serves innovative cocktails in both taste and presentation.</span> I can see Hampton and I coming back here whenever we're in London. </p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Drinking in the Costa Del Sol]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/29/drinking-costa-del-sol/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-29T11:37:41+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/29/drinking-costa-del-sol</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The next stage of our trip took us to the south of Spain – the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_del_Sol">Costa del Sol</a>,&rdquo; a clichéd destination for sun-starved Brits. My family were meeting us there and spending a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijas">Mijas</a> – a small village scattered on mountains overlooking the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Our fruitful cocktail hunt in Paris was great. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to push our luck, so we decided to try some more traditional drinks while in a less cosmopolitan area.</p>

<p>First up: fino. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fino">Fino</a> is a dry sherry served very cold. It&rsquo;s taken as an apéretif, and apparently it&rsquo;s what all the locals drink. I&rsquo;m a fan of sherry, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/fino.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Glass of fino</div>
</div>


<p>With regular sherry, the sweetness cuts through some of the flavour of the alcohol, which makes it palatable to me. With fino, you could definitely taste the alcohol compared with &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; sherry. The fino started with a sharp acidity, then followed with a fresher aftertaste. If I lived in Spain, I&rsquo;d probably get used to it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily order it again.</p>

<p>Next up, at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g580271-d2413104-Reviews-Pampa_Tablas_y_Tapas-Mijas_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html">a local tapas bar called Pampa</a>, we tried the stereotypical Spanish alcoholic drink: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangria">sangria</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/sangria.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Glass and pitcher of sangria</div>
</div>


<p>Sangria is awesome and I presume everyone has had it. If not, you should try it. It&rsquo;s traditionally made with red wine, brandy, and some kind of sweetener. You also put in pieces of chopped fruit. However, I believe this one had some rum in it as well. I&rsquo;ll try adding rum when I next make sangria at home, cause it added a nice kick.</p>

<p>On our final night, we went to a &ldquo;gin bar.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a slight misnomer: for one, it&rsquo;s more of a tapas place, and for two it served other alcohol as well. But gin is where this place shone. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/06/daily-chart-9">Spain is one of the highest per capita consumers of gin</a> (other fun facts from the linked infographic: India is the largest consumer of rum, and France is the largest consumer of Scotch). So, despite being a traditionally British drink, we had some Spanish-style gin and tonics.</p>

<p>The bar we were at, <a href="http://www.bodegaelplacer.com/">Bodega El Placer</a>, had about thirty gins on offer. There were five of us and we asked for five different gins, so we could sample them all. Each gin came in a big glass with ice and individually-prepared garnishes.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/just-gin.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Gin with garnishes</div>
</div>


<p>The garnishes ranged from juniper berries, cinnamon sticks and cardamom seeds to a simple lemon slice. The gins were all pretty different. Luckily, I liked a deep-flavoured sour gin that no one else enjoyed, so I didn&rsquo;t have to fight to finish that one off. I believe it was <a href="http://www.bulldoggin.com/">Bulldog gin</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/tonic-regular.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Gin and tonic</div>
</div>


<p>Fun fact: in most of Europe, when you want a gin and tonic, you just say &ldquo;gintonic.&rdquo; All one word.</p>

<p>They also had a blue tonic, but I&rsquo;m not really sure what the difference between regular tonic and the blue stuff was. I was a bad scientist and didn&rsquo;t do a same-gin, different-tonic experiment.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/tonic-blue.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Blue tonic?!</div>
</div>


<p>I should also mention the tapas: it was really good. It was more inventive than I was expecting – they had tempura aubergine with a honey sauce, and a melt-in-your-mouth tuna sashimi plate. My favourite, of course, was the jamón. It was one of the better jamón ibérico we had while in Spain.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/mijas/jamon.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Jamón ibérico</div>
</div>


<p>We were only in Spain a few days. Despite that, we managed to do two excellent day trips: one to Granada to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a> (check out some photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/malrase/sets/72157644507980879/">on Flickr</a>), and one to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/malrase/sets/72157644507822700/">Flickr photos</a>). If you&rsquo;re ever in the south of Spain, I highly recommend taking a trip to those. I also hear Seville is great, but we didn&rsquo;t make it there.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now on our way to the UK, which I&rsquo;m worried will be a bit of a shock. We&rsquo;re leaving sunny, 24ºC weather and heading towards a rainy 10ºC.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/25/early-morning-cdg-flight/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-25T13:59:34+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/25/early-morning-cdg-flight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We realised we had booked two early-morning flights from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport">Charles de Gaulle</a>, the main airport for Paris. We looked up if the metro/RER was running that early, but from our stop the times didn&rsquo;t work out. So the RER wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find much online, bar a few out-of-date forum posts, on alternative methods for getting to CDG that early, so I thought I&rsquo;d write our experiences down.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Shared Taxi</h2>

<p>For our first flight we got a shared taxi, using <a href="http://www.wecab.com">WeCab</a>. It was pretty simple to order online. You decide by what time you want to arrive at the airpot (we chose 6:30am, for a 7:15am flight). Then they give you a window during which they will pick you up. Our window was half an hour wide (5:25am to 5:55am), but as we are staying on the other side of Paris we expected the taxi would show up closer to 5:25am.</p>

<p>The cab showed up at 5:20am (!), and we had to rush a little to get out the door. The service said they would text 5 minutes before the taxi arrived, but they didn&rsquo;t. Thankfully, we were staying in a ground floor flat with a view of the road and I noticed the driver waiting outside.</p>

<p>We only picked up one other couple (the taxi had room for seven people), and we arrived at the airport with plenty of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: €46.30 for two (~$62)</li>
<li><strong>Wake-up time</strong>: 5:05am (for 7:20am flight)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Option 2: Hotel</h2>

<p>For our second flight, we decided to get a room in a hotel airport. We chose the <a href="http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-1404-ibis-paris-cdg-airport/index.shtml">ibis CDG Airport</a> – it&rsquo;s pretty much at Terminal 3, and was about a 15-minute trip (CDGVAL terminal shuttle and walking) to our check-in gate.</p>

<p>Our flight was on a Sunday, so we arrived at the hotel on the Saturday. Despite advertising a lot of food options, there was only one buffet for lunch so we ended up going into the airport itself for lunch. That evening, only <em>one</em> of the restaurants was open, with a 30-minute wait time for food and a long line out the door. Pretty poor, to be honest.</p>

<p>We were on an EasyJet flight to Malága, so we had to get to the airport pretty early. On EasyJet, you&rsquo;re only allowed one carry-on (not one suitcase and one laptop bag, <strong>just one</strong> bag). Baggage drop closes 40 mins before departure, and gates close 30 mins before departure. So we had to be there earlier than our previous flight. However, we still managed to get up later.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: €97 for two (~$132)</li>
<li><strong>Wake-up time</strong>: 5:30am (for 7:00am flight)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite the hotel we chose having a number of flaws, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend getting a hotel rather than the early-morning cab.</p>

<p>The peace of mind knowing you&rsquo;re in the airport complex, plus the convenience of a 15-minute automated train and walking journey, far outweigh the difference in price.</p>
