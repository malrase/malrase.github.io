    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We made it to Toronto! But more on that later. What&rsquo;s more important is drinking unusual alcohol. While in Toronto, we&rsquo;ve been hanging out with two of our awesome friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/mferrier">Mike</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">Melissa</a>. Last year, they visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ</a>, and <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=6587">bought a bottle of North Korean brandy</a> known as Paekrosul.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Paekrosul</div>
</div>


<p>Apparently its name translates as <a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/nieminen/chiew.html">&ldquo;Hundred-Years Liquour&rdquo;</a>, which is certainly promising.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>The bottle was a little tatty, and it was stoppered with a plastic cork. Inside, there was a bit of sandy sediment. Feeling the risk of going blind was one worth taking, we opened the bottle and poured ourselves a (small) glass.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Paekrosul, neat</div>
</div>


<p>I thought it smelled a lot like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu">baiju</a>, a Chinese liquour that my Dad always gets as a business gift. Others described it as having more of a turpentine aroma.</p>

<p>Despite its nose-burning smell, it tasted fine. Harsh at first, it quickly becomes sweeter and it didn&rsquo;t have a burning aftertaste that you get with a lot of high-proof drinks. No one really wanted to drink much more than a sip, though. What do you do when you have alcohol that no one&rsquo;s going to drink neat? You make a cocktail of course!</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Time to make a cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>Mike and Melissa have a well-stocked bar, so I had a lot of stuff to work with. But where to begin? I looked online for some brandy cocktails to see if I could modify them. One suggestion was the <a href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/mtropltn_cktl.htm">Metropolitan</a> – like a Manhattan but with brandy instead of whiskey. I used one part sweet vermouth to three parts paekrosul, plus some Angostura for good measure. It didn&rsquo;t taste that great, though. As the paekrosul was sweet already, the vermouth didn&rsquo;t contribute much. Plus the main off-putting thing about paekrosul was the smell. Neither the vermouth nor the bitters covered that up. Time to try a different route.</p>

<p>My favourite cocktails are all citrus-based. Citrus fruits also tend to have pretty strong aromas, so I thought using lemon or lime might be good.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/citrus.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/citrus.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Adding citrus makes everything better</div>
</div>


<p>I mixed in some lemon juice and it tasted pretty good. It tasted even better if you used a lemon peel as a garnish. Twisting the peel to spray the citrus oil over the drink covered up the turpentine smell pretty well.</p>

<p>I tried it with lime but it didn&rsquo;t work as well – the lime flavour wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p>

<p>I also ended up adding some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointreau">Cointreau triple sec</a> to the mix to add a little more citrus and sweetness.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">The final drink</div>
</div>


<p>Ta-da! It wasn&rsquo;t the best cocktail I&rsquo;ve ever made, but I think I did a good job of mostly masking the worst flavours of the paekrosul while keeping its more distinctive flavours. I&rsquo;m pretty sure by next summer it will be on every speakeasy menu from Brooklyn to the Mission.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t come up with a witty name yet, so suggestions are welcome.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Final ingredients</div>
</div>


<p>The recipe, if you want to make this at home (!), is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 parts Paekrosul</li>
<li>1 part Triple Sec</li>
<li>1 part lemon juice</li>
<li>Stir over ice, serve with an ice cube and lemon peel garnish.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-09-04T15:36:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/04/north-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before we do the North American stint of our journey, we had one final week in our favourite European city: Paris. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly all anxieties about travel or business evaporate when we&rsquo;re sat in a café drinking some wine.</p>

<p>We were staying in an area new to us: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre">Montmartre</a>. We were situated on the north side of the hill, behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_du_Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris">Sacré-Cœur</a>. It was a little tricky (but by no means impossible) to get to other areas that we usually hang out in (mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s">St Germain</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Quarter,_Paris">Latin Quarter</a>) – so we spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/cafe.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/cafe.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Chilling in a café</div>
</div>


<p>One of the first things we did was walk to the Sacré-Cœur. It&rsquo;s something you can see from most of Paris, perched on the top of Montmartre like a wedding cake topper. Neither of us had been before, so we trekked up the few hundred steps to the top.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/sc.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/sc.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">In front of the Sacré-Cœur</div>
</div>


<p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a beautiful church, but the view over Paris? It&rsquo;s&hellip; OK.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">View from the Sacré-Cœur</div>
</div>


<p>Sure, any vista over a city is kinda nice. But there just isn&rsquo;t much variation to make this one that interesting. It&rsquo;s just roofs – and you can maybe pick out the Centre Pompidou or Notre Dame in the distance if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc-annotated.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/view-sc-annotated.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">View from the Sacré-Cœur, with annotations!</div>
</div>


<p>The view from the top floor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou">Centre Pompidou</a> is much better, because you can see the stereotypical Parisian apartment buildings right there, but also see the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Sacré-Cœur, etc. in the background. It&rsquo;s a more satisfying view.</p>

<p>In short, the Sacré-Cœur looks perfectly fine from far away and I wouldn&rsquo;t bother climbing up all those steps unless you&rsquo;re really into churches.</p>

<p>Another touristy thing we did was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Orsay">Musée d'Orsay</a>. Housed in an old train station, it&rsquo;s renowned as one of the best collections of impressionist and post-impressionist art in the world. I&rsquo;d visited the museum before, and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy it. I was in a rush and (post-)impressionism isn&rsquo;t really my thing. Plus the queues for tickets are notorious – I&rsquo;ve heard stories of 2+ hours in line.</p>

<p>We were wandering past on a Thursday at 2pm and there was no line whatsoever for tickets. Apparently that&rsquo;s the time to go! On a whim, we went inside.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/orsay.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/orsay.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Musée d'Orsay</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s a gorgeous building, and the layout is innovative. The central aisle has sculptures and off the sides are the paintings. I must admit, I enjoyed the museum a lot more this time around. There was still a lot of stuff I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, but I found an appreciation for the &ldquo;greats&rdquo; – Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Van Gogh.</p>

<p>It was funny seeing the Orsay&rsquo;s Van Gogh collection – which completely blew away the collection of the Van Gogh Museum we visited in Amsterdam. Every classic painting is here – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#mediaviewer/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><strong>the</strong> self-portrait</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone">Starry Night over the Rhone</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_at_Auvers">The Church at Auvers</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Dr._Gachet">less-expensive Portrait of Dr Gachet</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Hell">plaster original of the Gates of Hell</a> by Rodin is also there, which is probably my favourite piece in the museum. During the visit, I went from completely hating the museum to thinking it&rsquo;s one of my favourites in Paris.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never toured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides">Les Invalides</a>, the building complex which houses the military history museum and home of Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb. We did that mostly to check off Parisian tourist things I hadn&rsquo;t yet done.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/paris/sept/tomb.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/sept/tomb.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Tomb of Napoleon, Les Invalides</div>
</div>


<p>If you&rsquo;re super into military history, you should go. I&rsquo;m&hellip; not, so the museum left me a little bored. The tomb of Napoleon was kinda cool, but that&rsquo;s about it. Oh, there was a sub-museum dedicated to the life of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>. It gushed about him, which was creepy enough, but both Hampton and I thought it left a negative impression of him by the end of it. He came across as a little dictatorial, to be honest. I need to read more about his time in politics to get a better grasp of what he did.</p>

<p>Anyway, we mostly spent our days drinking wine and coffee in cafés, which is a fine way to spend a week. Off to Toronto (by way of one night in Philadelphia) next!</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/29/halfway-ish-thoughts-so-far/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-29T06:28:24-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/29/halfway-ish-thoughts-so-far</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re about to head back to North America. That&rsquo;s right, the European leg of our 2014 journey is almost over. In a lot of ways, I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving. I feel a little short-changed – we only had <em>one day</em> in Vienna? Why didn&rsquo;t we make it to Budapest? Should we have spent time in a random British city, too?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the next leg of our trip: the East Coast. I&rsquo;m excited to learn more about Toronto and New York. I can&rsquo;t wait to drive down the East Coast as autumn descends and the leaves change. I&rsquo;m looking foward to using a more familiar currency, and for things to be not so expensive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking ahead to being back in San Francisco – being <em>home</em>. Travel is a lot of fun, and we&rsquo;re extremely aware of how lucky we are to be doing it, but it&rsquo;s quite exhausting and has a lot of anxiety associated with it. I&rsquo;ll probably write another post about that, though.</p>

<p>But now, we&rsquo;re at a half-way point in our travels. It&rsquo;s not literally a half-way point – we&rsquo;ve spent more time in Europe than we will on the East Coast – but it&rsquo;s close enough and is, if anything, almost a thematic half-way point. So I decided to do a bit of reflection on the packing aspect of travelling – whether I&rsquo;m regretting bringing that electric toothbrush, or how I feel about living out of a carry-on bag.</p>

<h3>Living from a carry-on</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad, to be honest. I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of the clothes I have, and some of them are a little bit worse-for-wear, but all in all it&rsquo;s fine. So far I&rsquo;ve not had the Fight Club-esque &ldquo;I want to get rid of more stuff&rdquo; epiphany, but I have thought about slimming down on some clothes at home, and definitely getting rid of some of our stuff in storage (do we <em>really</em> need all those wires?).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny that we&rsquo;ve been checking our bags for most of our European flights. It started because we were mainly flying with EasyJet, which has a strict one-bag-only policy. There was no way we could fit our laptop bags in our carry-ons, so we checked them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also been buying liquids in bigger quantities than we could take on the flight. Things like travel-sized shaving foam aren&rsquo;t always easy to come by, and it feels wasteful buying a whole can of foam just to throw it away after a couple of uses.</p>

<p>Having said that, using the carry-on as a &ldquo;way-of-mind,&rdquo; if you will, has been great. I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t pack a larger suitcase if I did this again. It&rsquo;s far more convenient to have a smaller bag when navigating small hotel rooms or getting on a train.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d brought</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things I wish I&rsquo;d brought – but to be honest, they&rsquo;ve been fairly easy to find abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Cups/re-useable bottle</strong> – in some AirBnB places we&rsquo;ve stayed in, they only had tiny water glasses. Most of the time, we&rsquo;ve ended up buying big bottles and refilling them. We bought two medium-sized plastic tumblers to take around in case we needed a mixed drink or something to pour into. They come in handy in hotel rooms, too!</p>

<p><strong>More bad shirts</strong> – I brought all my favourite shirts. Maybe this is just me, but I feel weird wearing my favourite stuff every day. They&rsquo;re already starting to get a little tatty. I wish I had some more simple shirts that I could easily throw away at the end of this trip.</p>

<h3>Things I wish I&rsquo;d left</h3>

<p><strong>Some contact lenses</strong> – I really overpacked for contact lenses. I brought enough to wear every other day, and I&rsquo;ve barely used them. I guess I thought I&rsquo;d be wearing my sunglasses more often.</p>

<p><strong>Running shorts</strong> – yeah, that was wishful thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Three shirts</strong> – (a.k.a. dress shirts or button-downs) I just don&rsquo;t wear these as much as I thought I would. I brought one ironable shirt and two non. I just don&rsquo;t wear the ironable one because it&rsquo;s too much hassle. I think one shirt would be plenty.</p>

<p>Summer is wrapping up in Europe and I&rsquo;m starting to wear my heavier clothes again. But for a while, when it was 30ºC-plus every day in Prague, I cursed myself for bringing a woolen jumper and a heavy cardigan. Much like in a few months, I will probably be wondering why I brought shorts (although I did wear them a bunch!).</p>

<h3>Things I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> glad I brought</h3>

<p><strong>T-Mobile SIM card</strong> – I can&rsquo;t sing the praises of (the USA company) T-Mobile enough; we switched to them just before we left the USA.  They have unlimited 3G data and texts for a large number of countries, including every country we&rsquo;ve visited. Being able to use Google Maps, or check your e-mail, without having to worry about paying through the nose for every single megabyte is incredibly relieving.</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong> – this might be obvious for people who have and love their iPads. I was never that into my iPad, but waiting in airports, taking train journeys, and other such times have made be really appreciate it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/23/stockholm/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-23T07:55:14-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/08/23/stockholm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We spent a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and I really recommend checking the conference out. Although I&rsquo;ve been to Sweden once before, I&rsquo;ve never been to Stockholm so I was pretty excited to check out this new city.</p>

<p>Stereotypes about Sweden that are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s cold – it was summer but it was 18ºC most days</li>
<li>everything is expensive</li>
<li>people wear brightly-coloured trousers (was that just a stereotype I had?)</li>
</ul>


<p>I like Sweden a lot. It&rsquo;s far more multicultural than I first expected (I had images of streets and streets filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed Scandanavians). Stockholm isn&rsquo;t as tourist-y as the last few places we&rsquo;ve been, either. It was refreshing at dinner to hear people around you speaking Swedish rather than English.</p>

<p>We only really had time for one day of touring, and when Hampton and I tour a city, we take it seriously. We looked up the top three things to do in Stockholm and made it a priority to check them off.</p>

<p>Stockholm is built on a bunch of islands – an archipelago, really. The centralmost island is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan">Gamla Stan</a>, &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo;. It has winding cobbled streets and alleyways and it&rsquo;s also the home of the royal palace. That&rsquo;s where we started our walking tour.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/stockholm/gamla-stan.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hampton looking over Gamla Stan</div>
</div>


<p></p>

<p>It was pretty, but full of tourist shops. We quickly headed over to the neighbouring island to check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Museet">Moderna Museet</a>. Although not as big as, say, MoMA or the Tate Modern, the collection is really good. It&rsquo;s manageable in size but also offers a great narrative over 20th century art.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/stockholm/moderna-calder.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Calder sculptures outside the museum</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we island hopped again – this time taking a ferry to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_museum">Vasa Museum</a>. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund">theme park</a> on the island – but it wasn&rsquo;t open. Sad times!</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)">Vasa</a> was a ship built in 1620s in preparation for a war against Poland. On its maiden voyage, it sank about 20 minutes after setting sail. It lay in the Stockholm bay for over 300 years, until it was recovered in the 1960s. It&rsquo;s still undergoing restoration and preservation, and it&rsquo;s housed in its own museum.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the largest intact boats on display from the 1600s, and it&rsquo;s in great shape.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Intricate carvings on the back of the Vasa</div>
</div>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s some areas of slightly lighter wood on the image above (the post on the top-left, and the cherub mid-right). Those are where the original carvings fell off and they re-carved them from new wood. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think that the rest of the carvings remained like that from when they were made in 1628.</p>

<p>Finally we headed back to the city centre (just north of gamla stan) for some food. We ate at a great Scandinavian restaurant called <a href="http://www.rolfskok.se/?lang=en">Rolf&rsquo;s Kök</a>. I had a super-rich ox cheek dish, and Hampton had a creamy fish stew. Both were delicious!</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ox cheek</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we realised that there was a <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/mikkeller-stockholm/">Mikkeller Bar</a> nearby. A Mikkeller Bar recently opened in San Francisco, but we never went. Why not go now, when we&rsquo;re half-way around the world?! So we went. I had a tasty IPA. Hampton tried asking the bartender if they had a British-style ale, but got a sassy reply, so had some wine instead.</p>

  <div class="alt">Viking 25 IPA</div>
</div>


<p>As if to remind me how silly it was going to a bar that&rsquo;s in my home city, they had the <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/01/13/mikkeller-introduces-mission-chinese-food-beer/">Mission Chinese</a> lager on the board, too.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mission Chinese beer</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we tried to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail. Pro-tip: don&rsquo;t try to find a decent, reasonably-priced cocktail in Stockholm. Cocktails are extremely expensive (think $20 up). We ended up in a hotel bar and got an overly-sweet Manhattan that barely covered the bottom of the glass it was served in.</p>

<p><em>Having said that</em>, we did get a list of cocktail bar recommendations from someone in Stockholm. We&rsquo;ll have to go back, if only to do a local&rsquo;s tour. Most of them seemed to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6dermalm">Södermalm</a>, which is apparently the hipster area of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Anyway, we had a lot of fun in the city and I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving so soon. Like Vienna, I want to make a point of visiting again, and staying longer next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a flight back to England, where we&rsquo;ll be spending the late August bank holiday weekend. After that, it&rsquo;s Paris for a week then back to the USA! It&rsquo;s strange how quickly this time has gone – it seems like no time has passed since we left San Francisco. However, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of travel left – our trip moving south along the East Coast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a great indoor market called <a href="http://www.markthalleneun.de/">Markthalle Neun</a> that&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=10953314371184579858&amp;q=Markthalle+Neun+GmbH&amp;ei=3sHwU4q8BLDQ7Aa4tYDgCg&amp;ved=0CL0BEPwSMA4">a block away from where we&rsquo;re staying</a>. It&rsquo;s not a traditional market in that there are people selling stuff every day. On a normal day there&rsquo;s a handful of stands or mini-kitchens selling locally-made food, wine, and other stuff.</p>

<p>On Thursdays, however, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;street food&rdquo; gathering where a lot more people show up. All the booths are filled with people selling their food – everything from pancakes to samosas to steamed buns. There&rsquo;s also a couple of food trucks outside, too. It gets incredibly packed, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a Sunday morning &ldquo;breakfast market,&rdquo; which has more of a focus on breakfast foods.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been to a couple of these events, but mostly we go on weekdays for lunch. There&rsquo;s such a wide variety of food there it&rsquo;s difficult to go wrong. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve taken pictures of pretty much everything I&rsquo;ve eaten there, so this will mainly be a bunch of pictures of delicious food.</p>

<p>The best thing I&rsquo;ve had so far has been the barbeque from <a href="http://www.bigstuff.de/">Big Stuff Smoked BBQ</a>. It blew away most of the BBQ I&rsquo;ve had in the USA.</p>

<p>There was a Vietnamese stall that did rice-stuffed rolls and some steamed buns.</p>

<p>There was a great vegetarian burger place. We accidentally went there because it had the shortest queue. Then we found out it was vegetarian, almost left, but stuck with it. The burger was so good! I think it was tofu or something, but it was mainly tasty cause they slathered it in peanut sauce.</p>

  <div class="alt">The best veggie-burger I've ever had</div>
</div>


<p>The next place I went to, I had their veggie-burger but it sucked, so I went back to eating all meat all the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m English so I love savoury pies. What luck! There was a pie place in the market. I got a cheese and mince one and it was SO GOOD. I would eat ten more right now.</p>

  <div class="alt">Cheese and mince pie (note: not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie">that kind of mince pie</a>, which would probably be gross with cheese in it)</div>
</div>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t like pies (like Hampton), you can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">reuben sandwich</a>! It had pastrami on it. Apparently this guy from Portland moved to Berlin and was upset he couldn&rsquo;t get decent pastrami&hellip; so he opened a deli!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fancy savoury items? Well there&rsquo;s a tonne of sweet stuff, too. There&rsquo;s a great waffle place.</p>

<p>Usually I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of waffles, but these were so good. Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Oh, and covered in caramel sauce.</p>

<p>The waffle place also did some crazy ice-creams&hellip;</p>

<p>And there was a lady selling ice-lollies (or &ldquo;popsicles&rdquo;).</p>

<p>OK, that&rsquo;s all my Markthalle photos. We did eat some fancy food as well – at <a href="http://www.sage-restaurant.de/cms/">Sage</a>. I really like the interior of this place. It&rsquo;s in a warehouse and has lots of industrial touches – like giant chains hanging from the ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also bright due to the large windows and white canvases on the walls.</p>

<p>We went for a four-course Chef&rsquo;s surprise menu. It was a great choice – full of interesting flavours and ingredients that I&rsquo;d never come across before. Here&rsquo;s some pictures:</p>

</div>


<p>It was super-tasty and you should definitely go if you&rsquo;re in the area. Get an apéritif on the beach beforehand!</p>

<p>Our time in Berlin is almost over, and next we&rsquo;ll be heading off to Stockholm for <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a>.</p>
