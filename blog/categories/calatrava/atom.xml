    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t visited many cities in France. Honestly, I&rsquo;m a bit lazy. I think, &ldquo;Why would you want to go anywhere other than Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However! Hampton was invited to a conference in Lyon (<a href="http://rulu.eu/">Ruby Lugdunum</a>, named after the Roman moniker for the town). As we were mostly either at the conference or eating, I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to look around most of the city. But I&rsquo;m still going to judge it based on what I did see.</p>

<p>The hotel was pretty damn good, actually. It was called <a href="http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-7236-mercure-lyon-brotteaux/index.shtml">Hotel Mercure</a>. They had a nice French breakfast every morning (mmm, croissants). It was pretty central, and the staff were nice.</p>

<p>Lyon itself was much more of a city-city than Paris. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re in Paris, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine someone actually living there. Lyon is a bustling place, with very few tourists. It feels like a financial centre.</p>

<p>The architecture was odd. I guess the city had mostly grown in the 60s/70s. There was lots of brutalist stuff &ndash; not that I&rsquo;m complaining, as I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut">béton</a> look. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard_University_Lyon_1">The Université Lyon 1</a> (where the conference was held) was made up pretty much exclusively of this stuff.</p>

<p>Although the buildings were interesting, they&rsquo;d been left to a surprising amount of decay. Paint peeling, weeds growing everywhere. It was pretty strange.</p>

<p>Oh, and on the topic of architecture, LYS had an awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">train station</a>, designed by Santiago Calatrava.</p>

<p>It was super-easy to use the city&rsquo;s transportation. The metro is neat and seems to go to all the major places in the city.</p>
