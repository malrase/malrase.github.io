    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re in New York City! The Big Apple! The city that never sleeps! Etc. etc.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d booked a small but nicely-designed AirBnB in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a>. After a small mix-up with the address (turns out the listed address was one street off, for some reason), we arrived and settled in. It was a little dirty, and there were no towels, but a quick stop at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bed+Bath+%26+Beyond/@40.7406703,-73.9942279,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x89c25d0c60996adb:0x480c0d194112b5d3!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sbed+bath+and+beyond+nyc!3m1!1s0x0:0x231ff6a484b76185">Bed, Bath and Beyond</a> sorted our need for cleaning supplies and linen.</p>

<p>Our first morning, we woke up and ran some quick errands. When we came back, the power was off at the apartment. We texted the host, who said that she was at work and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sort anything out until after 4pm – in about 6 hours (!). So&hellip; we wandered over to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art">Whitney</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons">Jeff Koons</a> retrospective. I love the Whitney – give me their brutalist architecture over the Guggenheim any day. They&rsquo;re moving to a new building next year so I&rsquo;m glad I got to visit their current space one last time.</p>

<p>The Koons retrospective was great. I was only familiar with a few of his works, and the exhibition did a great job of fleshing out the rest. The Equillibrium stuff was mesmerising. Definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re around (it&rsquo;s on until the 19th October, I think) – and grab the free audioguide too!</p>

  <div class="alt">Selfie in a Koons balloon</div>
</div>


<p>Still having a few hours to kill, we went to see a film. There&rsquo;s not a whole lot on right now (I&rsquo;m waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Girl_(film)">Gone Girl</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)">Inherent Vice</a> this autumn), so we took a chance on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drop_(film)">The Drop</a> with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and James Gandolfini. It&rsquo;s a slow-burning crime character study, although it&rsquo;s quite difficult to categorise. Tom Hardy does a great job of making a meek, loveable – but potentially dangerous – guy. It was also nice (but sad) to see James Gandolfini in what is his last feature-film role.</p>

<p>The film finished and we headed back to the apartment – the electricity was still off. We tried contacting our host, who told us that she&rsquo;d forgotten to pay the electricity bill for the past couple of months. Not only that, but everyone had gone home for the day and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to turn the power on until tomorrow. Oh dear.</p>

<p>By this point, it was starting to get dark and our living area looked a little bit like this:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/darkness.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The sofa</div>
</div>


<p>We called AirBnB who, to their credit, had great customer support. They said they&rsquo;d comp us for a meal and a hotel for that night. They said if the power wasn&rsquo;t on tomorrow, they&rsquo;d help us find a new place in NYC.</p>

<p>They arranged everything and got us a room at a <a href="https://www.kimptonhotels.com/stay/eventi-hotel-chelsea-ny">nearby Kimpton</a>. So, we packed up our satchels for an overnight adventure. We stopped for a quick meal on the way, and arrived at about 10:30pm. The check-in desk told us they were all booked up, and only had one strange room left – a library with a veranda. They said we could look at the room first, but we decided to go with it. At this point, as long as we had power we didn&rsquo;t really mind.</p>

<p>We got to the room and it was more of a suite or event space. One half had a library.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Library</div>
</div>


<p>And the other half had a dining room.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Panorama of the library</div>
</div>


<p>The room was on the corner of the building and had a wrap-around balcony/veranda. From there you had a great view of the Empire State Building.</p>

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/veranda-view.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The view from the veranda</div>
</div>


<p>We were feeling pretty great about this room until&hellip; wait, where was the bed?</p>

<p>Turns out, they forgot to bring a bed into the room. We called down to the front desk and they promptly sent up a couple of guys to make up a sofa bed for us.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/bed.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Our bed</div>
</div>


<p>It was pretty comfortable, for a sofa-bed. Anyway, to make up for the weird room and lack of a proper bed, they gave us some credit for room service. As we&rsquo;d already eaten, we used the credit on better things.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/power-out/wine.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Better things = wine</div>
</div>


<p>The next morning we headed back to the apartment and the power was still off – however the host had arranged for the electricity company and the super to come and get it all sorted out.</p>

<p>Although it was a bit of a nightmare, this is the first bad experience with AirBnB we&rsquo;ve had in the five months we&rsquo;ve been travelling. The AirBnB customer support was great, and the host also said she&rsquo;d give us the previous night free. Still, it was a pretty stressful adventure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a quick trip to Jacksonville for my father-in-law&rsquo;s birthday, our next stop was Philadelphia. I had only visited Philadelphia by passing through its airport, and I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it as a city, so I was excited to spend a few days there. I was on my best behaviour and only made one joke about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia">it being sunny</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Classic Philly chesse steak</div>
</div>


<p>Our first night we went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ranstead-room-philadelphia">the Ranstead Room</a>, at 20th and Ranstead. It&rsquo;s down an alley behind a modest black door.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Door to Ranstead Room</div>
</div>


<p>The cocktails were classics done well – try one of the fizzes if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start. The bartender was great at asking what you like and making something up. I got a Chartreuse and egg white drink (called the, uh, &ldquo;Chika Chika Boom Boom&rdquo;) that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>They serve food from the pared-down menu of their sister restaurant, El Rey. They had great tacos, plus some amazing popcorn with Jamaican spice that was both citrusy and umami.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Our delightful host</a> took us on a tour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City,_Philadelphia">Old City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_Hill,_Philadelphia">Society Hill</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_(Philadelphia)">South Street</a>. Old City and Society Hill have quaint colonial houses with a lot of history. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been living in San Francisco too long, but I was impressed with all the pre-1800 buildings.</p>

<p>We stopped in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jinxed-tuckers-digs-philadelphia">a neat store</a> that seemed to sell a lot of odd items (including lamps made out of what looked like spinal columns). On the way out, I looked down a small alley – <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@39.941169,-75.148958,3a,75y,102.7h,81.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sQadqWDkEoiNfRxrUPPZrGA!2e0">Kater St</a> – to see some incredible mosaic-murals.</p>

</div>


<p>The mosaics are the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Zagar">Isaiah Zagar</a>, who has around 200 mosaics in the South Street area of Philadelphia. They use a lot of mirror pieces and include quotations and the address of the place. They were mesmerising and I felt I could have spent hours sitting in front of them. Apparently there&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dream_(film)">a movie about him</a>, so I&rsquo;ll have to check that out.</p>

</div>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend more time in the South Street area of Philadelphia to find more of these murals.</p>

<h3>An aside:</h3>

<p>The amount of history in Philadelphia, especially regarding the founding of the United States and the beginning of the revolutionary war, was a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not ignorant of the history between the UK and the USA. Being British in the USA leads to good-natured ribbing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)">being a redcoat</a>. However, wandering around the centre of where the USA was founded and independence was sought is different. Everywhere there&rsquo;s information about how the revolutionaries were throwing off their repressive chains and seeking liberty. Implicit in all of the historical placards and explanatory signage was that they wanted to get away from the baddies. And in this case, the baddies were my ancestors (well, kinda).</p>

<p>I felt defensive, like I needed to stand up for my country: the UK wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad, was it? I&rsquo;m not a patriotic person, so feeling protective about my homeland was novel. I also felt conspicuous – that some tell would give me away, and people would be mad that the enemy was desecrating their site,  even though I was just standing there. I was sure I was only a moment away from being kicked out of the Constitution Museum or something.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really lived in another country, so I assume this is a pretty standard foreigner&rsquo;s paranoia. Maybe I should start wearing one of those sweet <a href="http://www.animalshirts.net/americanflagshirts/eaglefly.jpg">stars-and-stripes, eagle-soaring shirts</a> to blend in more.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/25/the-columbia-room/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-25T14:29:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/04/25/the-columbia-room</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>I was glad our friend had already been to <a href="http://columbiaroomdc.com/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">The Columbia Room</span></a> and met us outside, otherwise I don't think we would have been able to find it. It's hidden in the back of an upscale dive bar called The Passenger on 7th St in D.C. Inside, it's tiny (I think there were ten seats) and sparsely-decorated (some apothecary-style bottles with herbs were behind the bar). The service, level of expertise from the bartenders, and the inventiveness of flavour pairings reminded me of the few Michelin-starred restaurants I've been to. Except with liquor instead of food.</p>

  <p>The set menu consists of three drinks and a couple of snacks, coming in at around $65 per person. Pricey, but definitely worth it.</p>

  <!-- more -->

  <p>After being offered cold towels scented with cucumber (!), we started out with a rum and lemon-based punch served in a teacup. It tasted pretty much like iced tea – but, y'know, alcoholic. So better than regular iced tea.</p>

  <p>The second drink, the Getaway, had two main ingredients: a black rum and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynar">cynar</a> (<em>chee</em>-nar). </p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/dc/getaway-ingredients.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/getaway-ingredients.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Ingredients for the Getaway</div>
  </div>

  <p>Cynar is a dark brown artichoke-based liqueur. It has a number of other spices in it, so it's not like you're drinking artichoke juice or anything. Mixed with the dark rum, some salted bitters and a bit of lemon, and wow. With each sip you went through four or five different flavour profiles – acidity of the lemon, saltiness, herbs, molasses. It was extremely drinkable and all three of us had to pace ourselves so we didn't finish it in two gulps.</p>

  <p>The Getaway was served with an artichoke (to pair with the cynar) and green olive tapenade-type thing. It was pretty tasty, but I wish there had been more of it. Or maybe I should have eaten more for dinner.</p>

  <p>For last cocktail of the set, we had a choice. Either a cynar and grapefruit/blood orange soda <strong>or</strong> a cynar and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit">akvavit</a> combination. Two of us plumped for the cynar/aquavit drink – it tasted a lot like a negroni. The soda drink was refreshing and a nice end to the tasting.</p>

  <p>As the previous cocktails were so good, we decided to stay for another one each. We asked the bartender for two gin-based drinks – one with citrus and one without.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/dc/dry-martini.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/dry-martini.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Dry Martini</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hampton got a dry martini with Plymouth gin. It was pretty delicious. The bartender recommended Plymouth as a good go-to gin that mixes well with other ingredients.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-ingredients.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-ingredients.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Last Word Ingredients</div>
  </div>

  <p>I received a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Word_(cocktail)">Last Word</a> – Tanqueray 10 gin, Luxardo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino">maraschino liqueur</a>, lime juice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)">Chartreuse</a>. I had been drinking Chartreuse the previous Saturday, both neat and in a Chartreuse gimlet. I liked it a lot, so I was pretty excited it came up in the cocktail the bartender made for me here.</p>

  <p>The Maraschino liqueur was strange. I'm familiar with Luxardo-style maraschino cherries, so was expecting the liqueuer to be a deep purple syrup. However, it looked and tasted more like a simple syrup that had a hint of cherry flavour.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-cocktail.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/dc/last-word-cocktail.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Last Word</div>
  </div>

  <p>Mixing all of them together was amazing. The freshness of the limes worked well with the herbal qualities of the gin and the Chartreuse. The Maraschino added a touch of sweetness to round it all out. Apparently, the bartender likes to put a little more gin compared to normal Last Word-style drinks, which is what he said gives his the edge over the competition.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">I highly recommend visiting this place if you're in the D.C. area.</span> We managed to make reservations a couple of weeks in advance for a Wednesday night. I hear the building is being taken over soon – although I assume they will be moving to a new location.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first post on SF was a bit tourist-y. This one will be more focused on food and drink. And other funstuff.</p>

<p>We ate at a neat burger place on Union Sq &ndash; the aptly-named <a href="http://www.burger-bar.com/">Burger Bar</a>.</p>

<p>The milkshakes (picture missing) were amazing. The nutella one was just ice-cream and nutella, pretty much. The burger was good&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve had better (I&rsquo;m looking at you, The Bird in Berlin.)</p>

<p>We went to an awesome beach &ndash; China Beach. It was really quiet and had insane views of the Golden Gate and its bridge.</p>

<p>Oh, and something else I&rsquo;d highly recommend is Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It&rsquo;s on every Thursday and has a general theme every week (we went for 80s nostalgia/comedy). They have booze, you can wander around the exhibits, and they play pretty awesome music.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all I have to say. If you keep track of my whereabouts, you&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve now moved to San Francisco to live. It&rsquo;s awesome here!</p>

<p>We flew United 2623 from CLT to SFO. They had WIFI!!!!! Zomg. It&rsquo;s still a novelty for me. I don&rsquo;t have many photos of the CLT-SFO flight, just the food pretty much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been to San Francisco before, so it was a bit of an adventure. We only spent a couple of days doing touristy things, and the rest of the time was mostly Hampton working at Moovweb and me working on the book. Here&rsquo;s some tourist photos.</p>
