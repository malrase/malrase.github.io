    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Driving through Virginia is great – mostly because it reminds me of England. Gently rolling hills, lots of farms, big oak trees.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia">Charlottesville</a> was our first stop in Virginia. It&rsquo;s extremely beautiful and worth a visit – it&rsquo;s only a couple of hours to drive from Washington D.C. Just south of Charlottesville is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello">Monticello</a>, the residence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Compared with <a href="/blog/2014/10/28/east-coast-road-trip-part-two">the absurd cost to visit Biltmore</a>, Monticello is a steal – $25 per person. I&rsquo;d suggest booking in advance, especially on busy days. You can only go through the main part of the house as part of a guided tour – and those are every 15 minutes or so. It&rsquo;s nice to know when you need to show up.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Entrance to Monticello</div>
</div>


<p>The entrance to Monticello is at the bottom of a hill. It&rsquo;s got the usual visitor centre stuff – a gift shop, some small exhibits, a café, etc. All the stuff that you can&rsquo;t build next to the UNESCO-protected house.</p>

<p>You have two options for getting to the house itself – a five-minute bus ride or a fifteen-minute walk. We arrived about half an hour before our allotted tour and walked up. It&rsquo;s a great walk (although mostly uphill) and I&rsquo;d recommend doing it if you have the time/physical capability.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Walk up to Monticello</div>
</div>


<p>On the way up, you pass by the graveyard where Thomas Jefferson is buried.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Jefferson&#8217;s Grave</div>
</div>


<p>The grounds are expansive and the architecture of the complex is unique. There are a couple of terraces stretching along both sides of the house with servant quarters underneath. It&rsquo;s fun to wander around the outside a little. But be careful with your timing: the tours start far before their posted time. We arrived ten minutes before ours was due to start, and the group was already together and being told about the surrounding gardens.</p>

<p>The tour was equally interesting and overwhelming for me. I didn&rsquo;t know much about Thomas Jefferson – my British education wasn&rsquo;t focussed on American history. There were a lot of &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; facts that, for me, weren&rsquo;t so obvious. &ldquo;You all know that Jefferson and Adams had a fraught relationship,&rdquo; &ldquo;naturally you all know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings">Sally Hemings</a>.&rdquo; I had to nudge Hampton and ask him to fill in missing details. So if you&rsquo;re not American (or didn&rsquo;t pay attention in history), I&rsquo;d recommend reading up a little on his life before you come.</p>

<p>The house had some interesting areas. The entrance hall was used by Jefferson as a museum of sorts to prove to visitors that the Americas were ecologically and culturally distinct from the rest of Europe. Jefferson&rsquo;s bed was in an alcove that split his bedroom from his office. You can&rsquo;t take pictures inside, so I don&rsquo;t have any images of this stuff. But I do have a goofy photo of us standing outside the back of the house.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really picturesque on the grounds, and it&rsquo;s easy to take gorgeous photos.</p>

</div>


<p>Afterwards, we drove through Charlottesville and briefly saw the Jefferson-designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia">University of Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>That night we stayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton,_Virginia">Staunton</a>. It&rsquo;s a small town with a quiet centre and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_Presidential_Library">Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library</a>. We grabbed a Priceline deal at the <a href="http://www.stonewalljacksonhotel.com/">Stonewall Jackson Hotel</a>, which despite its questionable name, was fairly decent.</p>

<p>We found a well-reviewed cocktail bar and restaurant called <a href="http://zynodoa.com/">Zynodoa</a>. It was packed at 7:30pm on a Tuesday. Its decor and cocktails wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place in New York. The same went for its prices – the cheapest entrée was $25. So we decided to go somewhere that seemed a little lower-rent: a BBQ place called <a href="http://www.millstreetgrill.com/">Mill Street Grill</a> – it had great reviews so we were pretty excited.</p>

<p>I wish we&rsquo;d have stuck with Zynodoa. The entrées at Mill Street Grill were about the same price (~$25), and the menu reminded me of something out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a>. You know how Gordon Ramsay always complains when a menu is too large or haphazard? This menu was exactly that. There was Italian food, steaks, salads, BBQ, seafood, sandwiches. Hampton couldn&rsquo;t decide what he wanted, so he asked our waitress to pick from one of three. She didn&rsquo;t ask something like &ldquo;Do you like pasta?&rdquo; – she said &ldquo;How hungry are you?&rdquo; A bad sign.</p>

<p>We got our entrées and they were fairly tasty, but definitely not worth the price tag (why is some small town in Virginia charging so much?). The decor was bizarre – they had a bunch of deflated star and moon balloons hanging from the ceiling, a stained-glass window and a bust of Elvis (!?) on the bar. I&rsquo;d avoid it if you&rsquo;re ever in Staunton.</p>

<p>The next day we drove to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Virginia">Lexington, VA</a> – an even tinier town whose main attraction is the two universities. We were there to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University">Washington &amp; Lee</a>, where Hampton&rsquo;s father and brother both studied.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/washington-and-lee.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/washington-and-lee.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Washington & Lee</div>
</div>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chapel">Lee Chapel</a> is opposite the main buildings of the university, and we were lucky enough to catch a historian giving a short tour of the chapel explaining its history.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/lee-chapel.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/lee-chapel.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Lee Chapel</div>
</div>


<p>Inside it&rsquo;s all white. There are two portraits above the stage – one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a> and one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>. I found the Washington one amusing as he&rsquo;s in his British Army uniform. It&rsquo;s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Willson_Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a>, and I had to get a photo of it.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">George Washington in his British Army getup</div>
</div>


<p>In the back of the chapel is a statue of Lee. It&rsquo;s not a tomb – he&rsquo;s actually buried underneath the chapel in a crypt.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/lee-statue.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Recumbent statue of Lee</div>
</div>


<p>They also have a reconstruction of his office under the chapel. Right outside is buried Lee&rsquo;s beloved horse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(horse)">Traveller</a></p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/virginia/traveller.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Traveller&#8217;s grave</div>
</div>


<p>Visiting Washington &amp; Lee was a nice detour on our trip. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it from Hampton&rsquo;s father, and it was nice to see that.</p>

<p>A brief aside: I&rsquo;m still not comfortable with the promotion – if not glorification – of Confederate generals that occurs in the South. I&rsquo;ve heard various justifications on numerous occasions. I understand that Lee <em>himself</em> didn&rsquo;t agree with slavery, but had to go with what his home state of Virginia wanted. However it still feels wrong. And it&rsquo;s still jarring when I see names like Stonewall Jackson or Robert E. Lee on schools or highways.</p>

<p>We made a brief family-history stop on the way there. I&rsquo;ll probably write a longer blog post about this in the future, as it might be handy for some Marshall descendants to know about. In short, we visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Creek,_Virginia">Happy Creek</a>. One of Hampton&rsquo;s family lineages is the Marshall family. They owned a property in Virginia called Happy Creek which, around 1912, burned down. Here&rsquo;s the ruins:</p>

<p>Nearby, there&rsquo;s the Marshall family graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Markham_Marshall">James Markham Marshall</a> is the brother of the Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall">John Marshall</a> and also Hampton&rsquo;s great-(x4)-grandfather.</p>

<p>After visiting, we went to Washington D.C. to see our niece. Then we had a long drive back to Jacksonville – with one short stopover in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia">Savannah</a> because&hellip; well, why not? Savannah is beautiful. Now we&rsquo;re back in Jacksonville for a few days before heading to Orlando for a conference and (<em>cue spooky music</em>) <a href="http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com/orlando/">Halloween Horror Nights</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/28/east-coast-road-trip-part-two</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the southern outskirts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina">Asheville</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate">Biltmore Estate</a>. Built by the Vanderbilt family in the 1890s, it&rsquo;s the largest home in the U.S.A. and is open for tours. It&rsquo;s ridiculously expensive to visit – $60 per person is the cheapest adult ticket. Once you get in, there isn&rsquo;t much guidance on where to go, so the audio guide is well worth the extra $10. If you&rsquo;re spending $60 already&hellip; might as well, right?</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/biltmore.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/biltmore.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Front of Biltmore</div>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been to a fair share of grand homes in the UK and France, and it was interesting to see the American version of that. Obviously, this house was built way after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace">Blenheim</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles">Versailles</a>. It had a lot more modern aspects that surprised me. For example, electricity was used widely throughout the house – the clocks were synchronised that way. The indoor swimming pool (!) was lit with DC bulbs. There was an electric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbwaiter_(elevator)">dumbwaiter</a> from the kitchens. All of these &ldquo;modern&rdquo; marvels I&rsquo;d never seen in a grand home before.</p>

<p>Also, it was very noticeably a <em>home</em>, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily clear in other stately homes. Wandering around Versailles, how easy is it to imagine people living their lives there? Pretty tricky, in my opinion. Biltmore felt planned as a home – areas for family friends, areas for casual everyday living. It was far more welcoming in that regard. I&rsquo;m still not sure if it&rsquo;s worth the price tag, but I guess I&rsquo;m glad I saw it.</p>

<p>Asheville itself seemed nice, although we didn&rsquo;t stay in the centre. The only place we managed to get to was <a href="http://theadmiralnc.com/">The Admiral</a>, in the west side of the city. It was recommended by a number of people. Booking reservations was tricky – on a Monday night the only two slots were 5:30pm and 9pm. It&rsquo;s a popular place!</p>

<p>From the outside, it doesn&rsquo;t look like much.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The Admiral</div>
</div>


<p>It seems more like a dive bar than anything. Inside, it&rsquo;s even decorated like a bit of a dive bar. No tablecloths, neon beer signs on the wall. The menu is pretty high-falutin, though. Tasty cocktails to begin with.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-cocktails.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-cocktails.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Cocktails</div>
</div>


<p>Then some fancy versions of mostly Southern food. We ended up getting a bunch of small plates and one large plate – the pork chop – as we&rsquo;d heard so much about it. By far the stand-out dish was the mussels.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-mussels.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/admiral-mussels.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Mussels</div>
</div>


<p>They&rsquo;d been cooked in a PBR/tomato/chipotle broth and it was delicious. We also got the fried gnocchi, which tasted just like tater tots. The steak tartare was nice but came with a bunch of sriracha over the plate (whyyyyyy???). We got some fried sweetbreads with chipotle grits. They were good, but didn&rsquo;t really take advantage of the sweetbread itself – it could have been any random chunk of meat. The creaminess of the sweetbreads, if anything, just melded into the creamy grits. The pork chop was tough but tasty. It came with some way-too-sweet mac and cheese.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the meal we sat outside on the porch – right next to a gas fire. It was a pleasant end to the meal.</p>

<p>The next day, we headed to Raleigh for <a href="http://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a>. It&rsquo;s a gigantic conference – I think there were about 1,000 attendees and ten tracks. I didn&rsquo;t manage to go to half the talks I wanted to, but I did have a good time hanging out. I finally got to meet the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/trek">Trek</a>, who&rsquo;s hung out with Hampton at a bunch of conferences.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a decent cocktail in Raleigh, head to <a href="http://www.common414.com/">Common 414</a>. They had a solid selection of classic cocktails and didn&rsquo;t seem to get too busy (at least when we went, which admittedly tends to be earlier in the evening).</p>

<p>Due to a scheduling mix-up, we had to leave Raleigh earlier than anticipated. Our next couple of stops were in the heart of Virginia – and I&rsquo;ll be talking about those in the next post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After leaving New York, we flew down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida">Jacksonville</a>, Florida. We borrowed a car from Hampton&rsquo;s grandfather and started the next portion of our journey: the East Cost road trip. Hampton had been invited to conferences in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina">Raleigh</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida">Orlando</a>, plus we have family in North Carolina and DC, so we decided to drive around a little and I&rsquo;d get to see a few more of the off-the-beaten-track parts of the South.</p>

<p>Our first leg was from Jacksonville to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina">Greenville</a>, South Carolina. Hampton went to college at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_University">Furman</a> – just north of the town.</p>

<p>The drive up was lonnng – it took us about eight hours (including stops and some hellish traffic around Columbia). We passed through Georgia:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/georgia.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Is the 1996 Olympics the only thing Georgia is proud of?</div>
</div>


<p>And into South Carolina:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/sc-gates.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/sc-gates.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">South Carolina had some pretty sweet gates</div>
</div>


<p>After driving west across most of South Carolina, we stayed in Greenville for one night. It was a neat town, with a fair few restaurants and it was pretty lively at night. There was a young kid busking – doing magic tricks with his Dad, which was super-adorable.</p>

<p>We went to Furman the next morning. It&rsquo;s a self-contained campus and is quite beautiful. There&rsquo;s a lake surrounded by trees and a bell tower on one end.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/furman.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/furman.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">The bell tower</div>
</div>


<p>It was weird being at Hampton&rsquo;s old university. I think it was a strange trip for him, as he started recalling tales of parties or particular professors. What was also cool to see was the football pitch where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a> got his start.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/furman-soccer.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Furman&#8217;s football pitch</div>
</div>


<p>After that, we continued into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantahala_National_Forest">Nantahala National Forest</a>. There were a ton of beautiful lookout spots and hiking bits on the way there. Here&rsquo;s a few:</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/slide-rock.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/slide-rock.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Slide Rock: apparently kids slide down this. Seems pretty dangerous.</div>
</div>




<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/hiking.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/hiking.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Some hiking trail that ended up being way too long</div>
</div>




<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/table-rock.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/table-rock.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Table Rock, an outcrop</div>
</div>


<p>Table rock was a little unnerving. It&rsquo;s basically a large, gently-sloping rock overlooking the forest. Every time you think you&rsquo;re at the edge, you can walk a little bit further down. It was strange seeing people further down the rock and thinking, &ldquo;Wow, they&rsquo;re in a dangerous spot!&rdquo;&hellip; and then passing them.</p>

<p>Of course, driving around the South you see some interesting decorations.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/drivers.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/drivers.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Ahh, the South</div>
</div>


<p>We drove further up into the mountains and stayed at the <a href="http://www.highlandsinnlodge.com/highlandsInnLodgeIntro.html">Highlands Inn Lodge</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlands,_North_Carolina">Highlands</a>, North Carolina. It was a nice place, although a little out of the centre (but I&rsquo;m sure you could walk if necessary).</p>

<p>The leaves were amazing – every road was a bordered with greens, yellows, oranges, reds and browns.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="{{ root_url }}/images/the-journey/east-coast/leaves.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/east-coast/leaves.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Autumnnnnn</div>
</div>


<p>After spending a couple of nights in Highlands, we drove along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> through the forest. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous road – you&rsquo;re basically on the ridge of the mountain range and have epic views from both sides.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s stopping points every few hundred yards because there&rsquo;s that many photogenic scenes.</p>

<p>We were heading east across North Carolina to our next destination: Asheville. I&rsquo;ll write about that and our time in Raleigh in my next post!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week was the second <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a>. After having a blast last year, we had to come back (and it gave us a great excuse to be in New York City for a while).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/itsmisscs">Claudina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Snugug">Sam</a>, and the other organisers did a great job of having community events for the whole week in the run-up to the conference. A large number of SassConf attendees were staying in New York for a while, so it was a great idea to have some &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; community events beforehand.</p>

<p>There were great talks by <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith Schwartz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickhamann">Patrick Hamann</a> on Monday night. On Wednesday there was a fireside chat with the Sass Design team. Hampton talked about the original concept behind Sass and its unconventional branding, then <a href="https://twitter.com/jina">Jina Bolton</a> walked through the complete redesign of the <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass website</a> that she spearheaded last year.</p>

<p>It was a fitting topic – at last year&rsquo;s SassConf, the new website was launched. <a href="https://twitter.com/bermonpainter">Bermon Painter</a> joined in to explain the new logo, too. It was an entertaining evening.</p>

<p>The first day of the conference consisted of talks. It was neat hearing from <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una</a> about the global Sass community, and I always enjoy listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith</a> talk about art and how you can bring art into your everyday life.</p>

<p>It was also great to finally give <a href="https://twitter.com/nex3">Natalie</a> the <a href="https://thenetawards.com/">net Game-Changer of the Year award</a>. It was picked up by <a href="https://twitter.com/kaelig">Kaelig</a> back in May. He gave it to us when we were in London, then we asked my Mum to ship it to New York for SassConf.</p>

<p>The next day was workshop-based. I wasn&rsquo;t able to go to any, but from what I could see on Twitter people had a great time and learnt a lot.</p>

<p>The after-party was on Friday night, and it involved a boat trip (with open bar and karaoke) around the bottom of Manhattan. I guess boats are &ldquo;in&rdquo; at conferences – we did a boat trip for lunch during <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">LaConf</a> in Paris.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was <em>awesome</em>. Seeing any city from a new perspective is great, and Manhattan is absolutely gorgeous at night.</p>

<p>We sailed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Piers">Chelsea Piers</a> to near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. Then, on the way back, we got really close to the Statue of Liberty!</p>

<p>The number of attendees at the conference was small enough that you recognised most people at the after-party. I felt like I could go up to anyone and strike up a conversation. Everyone had a great time.</p>

<p>The next day was the &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; – something I&rsquo;m not familiar with at all. The idea is that people would form their own groups to talk/discuss/code about what they&rsquo;re feeling passionate about. I must admit, I was pretty sceptical going into the day. I expected it to end up being isolated people working on their own thing, with minimal discussions.</p>

<p>I was very wrong.</p>

</div>


<p>Within the first ten minutes, all the meeting rooms had been booked up with various meetings – everything from the minutiae of libsass to contributing to open source to motivation for making things. It was great seeing strangers come together to discuss these topics and try to figure out solutions or help each other out.</p>

<p>I recruited Smith and a couple of other people to help me with a project I&rsquo;ve been sitting on for a while. It&rsquo;s almost done and I&rsquo;ll be posting about it soon.</p>

<p>It was a great end to the conference, and really drove home one of the things that I believe sets the Sass community apart from most other tech communities I&rsquo;ve seen: the realisation that building a diverse and welcoming community is just as important as building the technology itself.</p>

    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post has an awkward title. That&rsquo;s chiefly because the bars in New York are so numerous that I couldn&rsquo;t claim knowledge of even 0.1 percent. I couldn&rsquo;t even claim to have exhausted bars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a> (our current neighbourhood), or even the Ninth Avenue bit of Chelsea. In fact, a more accurate title for this post would be &ldquo;Bars Between 20th and 17th Streets on Ninth Avenue: A Small Sampling.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange coming from Prague, where we managed to check off almost all of the decent cocktail bars in the centre, to a city where we&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been trying out some of the recommended bars in the area. We haven&rsquo;t found a bar we&rsquo;re completely comfortable with – the nice mix of decent cocktails and relaxed atmosphere has eluded us so far in Chelsea.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tipsyparson.com/">Tipsy Parson</a> is a great restaurant as well as a pretty good cocktail bar. You know how often, a Southern-style restaurant can&rsquo;t beat the food you actually get in the South? Well, that&rsquo;s not the case here. I had fried catfish with gravy, and Hampton had shrimp and grits. Both were great – the catfish was crisp and the gravy wasn&rsquo;t too peppery (which happens a lot with Southern gravy).</p>

<p>Looking at the menu, we spotted the head chef&rsquo;s name: Ty-Lör Boring. That&rsquo;s quite an unusual na- wait, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/people/ty-lor-boring/bio"><em>that</em> Ty-Lör</a>, from Top Chef?! It was!</p>

<p>They also have seats at the bar. The cocktails are a little bit hit and miss. They&rsquo;re trying hard to be inventive, but a lot of them miss the mark. There was a ginger-based drink that was <em>way</em> too gingery, even for me. The Professor Plum was pretty good, although due to seasonal changes of the menu I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s available any more.</p>

<p><a href="http://bathtubginnyc.com/">Bathtub Gin</a> is a speakeasy behind a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s quite conspicuous for a speakeasy – walking past on a Saturday night you see a line of people outside an empty coffee bar. I&rsquo;m no fool! No coffee is that tasty. We booked for 6pm on a quiet night and even then the bouncer made us wait outside, despite it being empty when we were eventually let in.</p>

<p>The drinks were quite good. We started out with a Martini and a Blushing Lady #2.</p>

<p>The Blushing Lady #2 tasted like a sour grape candy. The Martini was OK. The secound round proved better – a Vesper and a Last Word.</p>

<p>They had some great small plates to share – the mushroom gnocchi was my favourite. The pork belly sliders were also super-tasty.</p>

<p>The staff were a little stand-offish, which I&rsquo;m getting tired of when it comes to fancy speakeasy-style bars. Bourbon &amp; Branch in SF has a similar problem. (<em>Update</em>: we went to the speakeasy <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk and Honey</a> and the staff there were delightful. The drinks were great too!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php">La Bottega</a> is in a crazy-looking hotel called the Maritime. Its windows are all circular, and it&rsquo;s sides are sloped inwards. The drinks there are OK, but not very well balanced. The Vesper tasted like pure vodka; the Manhattan was almost pure vermouth.</p>

<p>Some other bars we&rsquo;ve been to in the Chelsea area (but not on 9th) are <a href="http://www.theparknyc.com/">The Park</a>, on 10th avenue, and <a href="http://heartwoodnyc.com/">Heartwood</a>, on 8th.</p>

<p>The Park is in a beautiful converted parking garage, with an indoor &ldquo;garden&rdquo; area. The front bar was pretty crowded, so we sat in the garden area where – pro-tip – there&rsquo;s a secret back bar! We ordered drinks from both and the back bartender was way better. Plus there was no wait at the back bar.</p>

<p>Heartwood is on 8th Avenue, between 20th and 19th. I ordered a couple of drinks there and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy them – one was my fault, the other the bartender&rsquo;s. The menu had sections, one of which was classifed as &ldquo;Shrubs.&rdquo; Not being familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_(drink)">drink called a shrub</a>, I picked one with gin in it. Turns out, they really do put vinegar in them. It was surprising on first taste, then just became kinda throat-burning. I love vinegar, but drinking it is a little difficult. Anyway, I put that mistake down to me, and not the bar itself. However, I then ordered a Last Word and they missed out the lime. That makes it a little undrinkable – just sweet and herbal. My first drink was too acidic, my next not acidic enough. There&rsquo;s no pleasing me.</p>

<p>Anyway, SassConf has started and I&rsquo;ll no doubt be writing about that as the week goes on.</p>
