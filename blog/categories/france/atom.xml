    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise that Lyon was the centre for French gastronomy. But apparently it is. Anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d devote a whole post to the food I ate there, in addition to my first post on the city itself.</p>

<p>The first night, we ate at <a href="http://www.brasseriegeorges.com/">Brasserie Georges</a>. It&rsquo;s apparently pretty famous (it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasserie_Georges">Wikipedia article</a> &ndash; a sure sign of prominence). They served some traditional Lyon food &ndash; including a pistachio sausage thing, which was pretty nice. Also on the list of traditional Lyon foods were a mustard sausage and calf&rsquo;s head. I think I made the right choice with a pistachio sausage.</p>

    I forgot to take pictures of the food, so here's one of Hampton.

<p>The second evening, we went to a place called <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1256&amp;bih=738&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Les+enfants+terribles+lyon&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=Les+enfants+terribles&amp;hnear=0x47f4ea516ae88797:0x408ab2ae4bb21f0,Lyon,+France&amp;cid=9879979365541420669">Les Enfants Terribles</a>&hellip; it was OK. Nothing too special. The duck salad I had to start had too much mustard dressing on it. The main was beef, coupled with some deeeeelicious dauphinoise potatoes. I think they must have used chicken stock or something. The dessert was pretty good&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not much of a surprise as I love all tartes au citron. The filling had a strange granular texture &ndash; I think they might have added ground almonds or something.</p>

<p>For Sunday lunch, we went to a pretty decent restaurant near the hotel (in the Brotteaux area) &ndash; it was called <a href="http://www.nordsudbrasseries.com/">Brasserie de l'Est</a>. It seems to be part of a chain. The food was pretty good! I&rsquo;d recommend it. I forgot to take pictures, though.</p>

<p>On our final night, we ended up at <a href="http://www.hippopotamus.fr/">Hippopotamus</a>. I&rsquo;ve seen a few in Paris. They&rsquo;re some kind of chain that serves vaguely French food &ndash; steaks, etc. It was, as we kinda expected, mediocre. I had an assortment of fried goods. It was very American.</p>

<p>One of the better meals I had was (strangely?) at the airport. It was the airport branch of the 2-Michelin-starred <a href="http://www.nicolaslebec.com/">Nicolas Le Bec</a>, which is in the centre of Lyon. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.espace-lebec.com/">Espace Le Bec</a>. We both had a really delicious penne with bolognese. It had the most amazing cheese sliced over it, too. SO GOOD.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much all the food I ate in Lyon. I wasn&rsquo;t there that long, so I can&rsquo;t really confirm or deny its status as le centre gastronomique of France. I&rsquo;ve had better meals in Paris. (But Espace Le Bec was definitely the best meal I&rsquo;ve had at an airport.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t visited many cities in France. Honestly, I&rsquo;m a bit lazy. I think, &ldquo;Why would you want to go anywhere other than Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However! Hampton was invited to a conference in Lyon (<a href="http://rulu.eu/">Ruby Lugdunum</a>, named after the Roman moniker for the town). As we were mostly either at the conference or eating, I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to look around most of the city. But I&rsquo;m still going to judge it based on what I did see.</p>

<p>The hotel was pretty damn good, actually. It was called <a href="http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-7236-mercure-lyon-brotteaux/index.shtml">Hotel Mercure</a>. They had a nice French breakfast every morning (mmm, croissants). It was pretty central, and the staff were nice.</p>

<p>Lyon itself was much more of a city-city than Paris. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re in Paris, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine someone actually living there. Lyon is a bustling place, with very few tourists. It feels like a financial centre.</p>

<p>The architecture was odd. I guess the city had mostly grown in the 60s/70s. There was lots of brutalist stuff &ndash; not that I&rsquo;m complaining, as I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut">béton</a> look. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard_University_Lyon_1">The Université Lyon 1</a> (where the conference was held) was made up pretty much exclusively of this stuff.</p>

<p>Although the buildings were interesting, they&rsquo;d been left to a surprising amount of decay. Paint peeling, weeds growing everywhere. It was pretty strange.</p>

<p>Oh, and on the topic of architecture, LYS had an awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">train station</a>, designed by Santiago Calatrava.</p>

<p>It was super-easy to use the city&rsquo;s transportation. The metro is neat and seems to go to all the major places in the city.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After our trip to Zürich, we went to Paris by train. As with most rail travel in Europe, it was a great way to move between cities. There was a lot of kerfuffle with the hotels when we arrived &ndash; but we ended up in the beautiful <a href="http://www.closmedicis.com/">Hotel de Clos Medicis</a>. We were in the attic, which had amazing exposed beams and an upstairs bathroom.</p>

<p>Best of all, we were in the Latin Quarter, which is so much fun. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;bohemian&rdquo; area of Paris, with lots of cool bars, cafés and restaurants to eat in. Which is what we mainly ended up doing.Hampton and I have done most of the touristy things in Paris before &ndash; and we were there in March, too. When we were there, we discovered our love for the café culture. Seriously, why hasn&rsquo;t it been rolled out across the world yet? We would sit in a café from 3pm until 7pm reading, drinking wine. We&rsquo;d go for a meal somewhere, then return to another café for more wine, leaving at around 2am. It&rsquo;s so refreshing.</p>

<p>Anyway, this time we tried to do the same thing. We ate a lot of good food. My favourite restaurant was <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d715085-Reviews-Fish_la_Boissonnerie-Paris_Ile_de_France.html">Fish Le Boissonnerie</a>. Some pictures follow.</p>

  <div class="alt">The dessert: crème brûlée.</div>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of the bread, though. The bread (which I think they got from an Italian restaurant across the street) was the most amazing foccacia I have ever tasted. I&rsquo;d go back to that restaurant solely for the bread.</p>

<p>So, other random things we did in Paris. We went on a boat tour along the Seine, which was nice. But it was super hot (a lot warmer than Zürich, that&rsquo;s for sure).</p>

<div class="img">

<p>We visited the <a href="http://equipement.paris.fr/marche-aux-fleurs-et-aux-oiseaux-cite-4506">marché des oiseaux</a> on Sunday. Every Sunday, the flower market on the Île de la Cité also has a bunch of guys selling birds. It was bizarre, and unsettling how many birds they can fit into those tiny cages.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://malrase.github.io/images/paris/finches.jpg">
  <div class="alt">So many birds in such a small cage.</div>
</div>


<p>As for cafés, my favourite is still <a href="https://plus.google.com/117060472644786113352/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en">Le Contrescarpe</a>, on Rue Mouffetard. However, the best wine was definitely at <a href="http://www.michelrostang.com/">Le Rostand</a>, which was facing the Jardin du Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t really go to that many &ldquo;bars&rdquo;, but we did go to <a href="http://www.bowlingmouffetard.fr/">Le Bowling Mouffetard</a>, a mix of Americana and UV lighting &ndash; in a bowling alley. That was very enjoyable. I remember going when I was in Paris in 2006. I&rsquo;m surprised I managed to find it again.</p>

<p>As the Royal Wedding is coming up, every French magazine seemed to have a cover story about the couple. This one really weirded me out:</p>
