    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our first major stop in Europe has been Paris. We&rsquo;re staying in an area new to us: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte-aux-Cailles">la Butte-aux-Cailles</a>. It&rsquo;s in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_arrondissement_of_Paris">13th arrondissement</a> of Paris, in the south-east of the city.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood has a small-town feel, and isn&rsquo;t touristy at all. I&rsquo;ve only encountered other English-speakers when I&rsquo;ve left the area. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to get to other places, as the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_d'Italie">Place d'Italie</a> has a number of lines from its Métro stop.</p>

<p>There are a decent number of bars, cafés and restaurants on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+de+la+Butte+aux+Cailles/@48.8277143,2.3498739,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e67190f05e1315:0x4771112c8d0bf60b">the main street</a>. From about 6pm to midnight, they&rsquo;re packed with people – so much so, that there&rsquo;s often a crowd spilling out onto the street. It&rsquo;s a little strange for a neighbourhood that&rsquo;s fairly quiet the rest of the time.</p>

<p>Anyway, the thing that struck me the most about the area was that it seems to have a large amount of street art (apparently <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-26/how-overprotective-paris-became-the-center-of-street-art-.html">Paris is becoming the &ldquo;center of street art&rdquo;</a>). Every wall seems to have something beautiful or provocative on it.</p>

<p>The most famous (as far as I can tell) street art in the area is done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampsa_(street_artist)">Sampsa</a>, the &ldquo;Finnish Banksy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img">

  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/butte-art/hadopi.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Close-up of a HADOPI enforcer</div>
</div>


<p>The two pieces by Sampsa were in protest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law">HADOPI law</a> – a copyright infringement law from around 2009. Amusingly, the first logo for the HADOPI agency used <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6974249/Anti-piracy-agencys-logo-broke-copyright.html">a typeface without appropriate licensing</a>.</p>

  <div class="alt">The blood sucking HADOPI</div>
</div>


<p>The mosquito art was <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/paris-censored-anti-copyright-street-art">censored for a while</a> – removing the &ldquo;Blood sucking HADOPI&rdquo; line. But apparently it has been recently restored.</p>

<p>There are a bunch artworks done in mostly muted blues and greys. They&rsquo;re all of children. At first glance, they&rsquo;re kind of peaceful.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/butte-art/boat.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Boat</div>
</div>


<p>However when I started to study them there was something unnerving about them. The children never had faces.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/paris/butte-art/boy.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Painter boy</div>
</div>


<p>As well as the lack of faces, the children are usually disappearing. They&rsquo;re walking through a waterfall or curtain into another world. Or they&rsquo;re being partially submerged. They&rsquo;re a little eerie.</p>

</div>


<p><a href="http://www.missticinparis.com/">Miss.tic</a> is another artist with a lot of works in the area. According to <a href="http://www.missticinparis.com/misstic_biographie.html">her biography page</a>, she&rsquo;s almost 60 years old. She has a bunch of stencils that tend to be of provocatively-posed ladies with humourous or ironic captions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done my best to translate the captions, but they&rsquo;ll no doubt be a little off. If anyone wants to correct me, please do!</p>

<div class="img">

<p>Miss.tic doesn&rsquo;t only do scantily-clad ladies, though.</p>

<p>There are a couple of sculptures by the Italian street art group <a href="http://www.urbansolid.org/">UrbanSolid</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>I liked these, although the prisoner is just around a tight corner, and at night I keep thinking there&rsquo;s a person waiting there. It&rsquo;s a little creepy.</p>

<p>There are a few pieces by <a href="http://www.janaundjs.com/">Jana und JS</a>. They have a nice style, and do work in a number of European cities. I like their focus on photography/photographers, who appear in a lot of their works.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a small gecko logo next to a lot of the art. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what the symbol is for – looking up the <a href="http://www.lezarts-bievre.com/">Lézarts de la Bièvre</a>, it seems to be some kind of art event held in June, with a focus on street artists.</p>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s a bunch of other neat stuff I saw that seemed to be one-offs by artists (at least, one-offs for this area).</p>

<p>Anyway, I <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/48.8310625,2.3552585/48.8280933,2.3526657/48.8266199,2.3479307/48.8290213,2.3478663/48.8288321,2.3507471/48.8310907,2.3552156/@48.8292438,2.3512191,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e2">google-mapped</a> (Is &ldquo;google-map&rdquo; a verb? It is now, I guess) the route I took. It starts and ends at Place d'Italie, in case you&rsquo;re arriving by Métro, and takes about 30 minutes. Of course, just wandering around the neighbourhood – especially on a Sunday morning, when it&rsquo;s super-quiet – is nice too.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re leaving this area in the next couple of days to move to a hotel for <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">La Conf</a>. After that, it&rsquo;s off to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> to meet my family.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-13T13:33:20+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/05/13/vienna</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We took the <a href="https://westbahn.at/en/">Westbahn</a> from Linz to Vienna. It leaves every 30mins and takes about 1hr 20mins to get there. The train was swish – clean, with free wi-fi, power ports next to every seat. Plus a conductor (?) came through so you could buy tickets and drinks/snacks. I wish all trains were this nice.</p>

<p>It was pouring when we arrived in Vienna, so although we only had around 24hrs there, we didn&rsquo;t do much during the afternoon. However, that night we had a <a href="http://twitter.com/bastilian">friend</a> to take us to a restaurant and some bars.</p>

<p><a href="http://ulrichwien.at/">Ulrich</a> was a neat restaurant that wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place in San Francisco. It had clean, hip decor and a menu focusing on quality ingredients. The roast chicken was so good (but can you go wrong when you offer a side of bernaise with something?). We then went to <a href="http://www.barflys.at/en/">Barflys</a>, which I&rsquo;d read about as one of the top cocktail bars in Vienna. It&rsquo;s hidden in a hotel, but the cocktails are pretty decent, with more of a focus on US-stye than Cocktailbar Easy (I didn&rsquo;t see one pineapple wedge). However, it was a small room and allows smoking, so&hellip; it was a little suffocating in there.</p>

<p>Finally, we went to <a href="http://www.donautechno.com/main/">Donnau Techno</a>. It&rsquo;s behind an un-marked door in a quiet alley. Inside had an &ldquo;East Berlin&rdquo; feel – the floor was concrete and the furniture was fairly cheap. Ice was served from a bucket. There was a stand in the corner that sold sausages and pickles. The interior had vaulted ceilings and columns, and onto the walls were projected images. Apparently they change every night, as does the techno DJ behind a make-shift booth. We were there on a Sunday, so it was fairly quiet, but apparently it gets packed almost every other night of the week.</p>

<p>The next morning it was beautiful out, so Sebastian took us on a quick yet thorough walking tour of Vienna. We started in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumsquartier">Museumsquartier</a> (or &ldquo;MQ&rdquo;), a quadrangle with a number of museums.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Modern art museum – "mumok"</div>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t have time to stop in any of them. Next time, I promise. We wandered past the Natural History Museum to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofburg_Palace">Hofburg Palace</a>, the winter residence of the Hapsburgs and the current residence of the President of Austria.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Hofburg Palace</div>
</div>


<p>We then walked past the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathaus,_Vienna">Rathaus</a>, a beautiful gothic building. After that, we went through the windy streets of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innere_Stadt">first district</a> where there were lots of expensive shops and embassies.</p>

<p>We ended up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephansplatz,_Vienna">Stephansplatz</a>, containing the impressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephansdom">Stephansdom</a>. The roof in particular, a mosaic of coloured tiles, was spectacular.</p>

<div class="img">

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/MuseumsQuartier,+Museumsplatz+1,+1070+Wien,+Austria/Heldenplatz,+1010+Wien,+Austria/48.2078019,16.3626916/48.210245,16.3605972/Stephansplatz,+1010+Wien,+Austria/@48.2145398,16.362559,15z/data=!4m27!4m26!1m5!1m1!1s0x476d07903eeb4fdf:0x94d429b3eb41ebff!2m2!1d16.358617!2d48.203337!1m5!1m1!1s0x476d0790aaca9f7f:0xc9b8a532e4d2e43a!2m2!1d16.363175!2d48.206358!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d16.3695358!2d48.2087922!3s0x476d0798e8c0b245:0x3759b284e1f4e281!1m5!1m1!1s0x476d079f3e69c281:0x20563c156aa1fde!2m2!1d16.374238!2d48.2085053!3e2">I made a rough map of the route we took</a> – it took us about an hour to wander through it, as we paused a lot to take photos. If you&rsquo;re short on time and need a whistle-stop tour, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. However, we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to really take in everything. We would both love to come back to Vienna and maybe even go in some of the wonderful buildings we passed.</p>

<p>Plus, there seem to be a number of great bars and restaurants which we couldn&rsquo;t make it to. We&rsquo;ll be back soon!</p>
