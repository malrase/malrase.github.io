    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We landed late on a Thursday, and managed to catch the <a href="http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/ae_outline/index.php">Keisei Skyliner</a> to our first hotel. We were staying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a>, the electronics district. It was overwhelming when we first arrived.</p>

<p>I had an idea of what Tokyo would be like, and this was it turned up to 11. Neon signs were attached to every building. Video screens were selling you products or pop bands. People were shouting on the street for you to come into their bar/arcade/store. It was a sensory overload&emdash;not helped by just having taken a 10 hour flight on which I didn&rsquo;t sleep. We went to bed pretty soon after arriving.</p>

<p>The next day, we headed over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukiji_fish_market">Tsukiji</a> fish market. It&rsquo;s a slightly cliché first-day-in-Tokyo thing to do, but it&rsquo;s apparently being moved to somewhere else in the Autumn, so we wanted to do it at least once. It&rsquo;s a labyrinth of small restaurants, fishmongers, and other shops selling knives/chopsticks/etc.</p>

</div>


<p>But the best part is the cheap, amazing fresh sushi you get find in the area. We picked a place at random, opting for a sushi bar that looked reasonably packed but without too much of a wait.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Sushi bar!</div>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to describe the ensuing bounty. The fish was cold and tender, the rice warm and sticky. It was probably the best sushi I&rsquo;d ever had (until a couple of days later, but that&rsquo;s for a different post).</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Freshest fish I&#8217;ll eat, probably</div>
</div>


<p>Just looking at this makes me want to eat it again. The best piece was the fatty tuna, on the top-left of the board. Delicious.</p>

<p>After the market, we headed over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueno_Park">Ueno Park</a>, an urban park with a number of shrines and museums. Unfortunately, the National Museum of Western Art was closed, so we ended up going to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_National_Museum">Tokyo National Museum</a> instead.</p>

</div>


<p>It provided a nice overview, for ignorant people such as myself, to the broad history of Tokyo (and, to some extent, Japan). There was also a special exhibition on&emdash;some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army">Terracotta Army</a> were on display. So we spent a little more and got entrance to that, too.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Some (fake) terracotta warriors&#8230; we weren&#8217;t allowed to take pictures of the real ones</div>
</div>


<p>They were fairly impressive, I suppose, but the exhibition was in its last few days so it was packed. You could barely move in there. But I guess I can check it off the bucket list?</p>

<p>Anyway, we went back to the hotel to relax before heading out for dinner. This was our first major meal in Tokyo, and introduced us to one of the jarring ways to deal with such density of people. In most cities I&rsquo;ve been to, restaurants (and bars) have a street-level entrance. Not here. Restaurants are found on seemingly any floor of a building. In this case, we went for <a href="">yakiniku</a> on the fourth floor of a building. (<em>So, I should note, it&rsquo;s important to figure out what floor a restaurant is on when you look up an address.</em>)</p>

<p>Yakiniku is basically grilled stuff. And we grilled a whole bunch-o-meat on our very own grill.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Tasty meat, pre-grilling</div>
</div>


<p>Weird cultural thing I didn&rsquo;t know before going to Japan: smoking indoors is pretty much A-OK, even in restaurants. It was odd being in a kinda-fancy restaurant and having the table next to us start blowing smoke in our direction. Boo.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we went &ldquo;next door&rdquo; (read: across the floor) to a British-style pub. It&rsquo;s part of a chain called the HUB. It was pretty fun, but it was odd because inside was smoking only&hellip; so we sat outside, right near the elevator. Odd times.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our first trip of 2016, and it&rsquo;s a big one: we&rsquo;re heading to Japan for two weeks.</p>

<p>Japan has been top of my destinations list for a while. As <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com">Melissa</a> and <a href="http://mikeferrier.com">Mike</a> booked a trip to Osaka, we decided to join in on their fun. The itinerary is roughly as follows: 4 days in Tokyo, 4 days in Osaka, 1 day in Kyoto, then back to Tokyo for 5 days.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s start with the most interesting part: our flights there! We decided to book with [Singapore Airlines]–the LAX-NRT flight was on an A380 (yay) and we&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re pretty nice. Plus, they have recently introduced Premium Economy&hellip; making the 11-hour flight just a little more palatable.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day before we got a phone call saying that there was no Premium Economy on the plane we were going to take. Uh-oh. The person said it would be fine, just ask at the check-in desk when we arrive.</p>

<p>Only problem is: we were flying with Virgin America from SFO to get to LAX. With a tight layover, were we going to have time to visit the Singapore Airlines check-in desk? When we arrived at SFO, the Virgin America crew couldn&rsquo;t even give us the boarding pass for our second leg. That made us even more nervous. But we weren&rsquo;t showing it.</p>

<p>We landed in L.A. and rushed to the International Terminal (which was thankfully just next to the terminal we landed at). We went to the check-in desk and&hellip;</p>

</div>


<p>We were upgraded to Business Class! Holy moly! I never thought I&rsquo;d fly Singapore Airlines Business Class, but there you go. Plus it was upstairs on the A380!</p>

<p>Before we got on the plane, we hung out in the Star Alliance Lounge, which was pretty nice. The best bit (aside from the free drinks) was the build-your-own-noodle-bowl bar.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and this is when I started my drinking. It&rsquo;s vacation time!</p>

<p>They also had some really nice dessert &ldquo;shooters,&rdquo; which unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t fit a spoon into them. So I ate them with a knife instead. Keeping it classy, as always.</p>

<p>Over the intercom, they announced that our flight was boarding. Time to go! Going up an escalator to get to the entry was awesome. I love the A380 so much.</p>

<p>The seats you get in Business Class are amazing. They&rsquo;re (faux?) leather, and you get some comfy pillows too. The craziest thing was how wide they were. I think you could fit two Michaels in one of these seats.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Seriously, the seat was so wide</div>
</div>


<p>Also, Business Class was really empty. No one was in the seats behind us or diagonal to us. Which came in handy when my table was broken and I had to switch seats.</p>

  <a href="/images/japan/flights/empty-rows.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/japan/flights/empty-rows.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">My new seat (only used for eating)</div>
</div>


<p>The seat had a number of cool features. There was a little pop-down table for drinks, and a mirror. There were power sockets for regular plugs and USB! Plus a neat little compartment for putting my phone in. We got some slippers and some noise-cancelling headphones (which were actually pretty good).</p>

</div>


<p>Now onto the food. Singapore Airlines has a thing called &ldquo;Book the Cook.&rdquo; Basically, it&rsquo;s like pre-ordering the meal you want <em>before</em> you get on your flight. You can choose some really delicious-sounding stuff! The menu we got when we sat down also offered <em>hanakoireki</em>, which was like a bento-box thing. Hampton went for the hanakoireki, and I got the chef&rsquo;s meal. It was all superb.</p>

</div>


<p>They also had a pretty decent cocktail list. I got a Singapore Sling (duh), which was really rather good.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing: the bathroom was full of useful items. Razors, toothbrush/toothpaste, mouthwash&hellip; handy for a 10 hour flight.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/japan/flights/bathroom-1.jpg">

  <div class="alt">Plus razors, toothbrushes, combs&#8230;</div>
</div>


<p>After eating, the lovely staff of Singapore Airlines made my seat into a lie-flat bed. It was actually pretty comfortable.</p>

  <a href="/images/japan/flights/bed.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">My sky-bed</div>
</div>


<p>As we were waking up, we had our &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;. (A weird thing about long flights: the names of the meals you&rsquo;re served rarely correspond to when you get them.) Yay, more yummy food!</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/japan/flights/dinner-starter.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/japan/flights/dinner-starter.jpg">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/japan/flights/dinner-dessert.jpg">

  <div class="alt">Dessert: green tea cake</div>
</div>


<p>And then, despite my yearning for a longer flight with this amazing service and food, we landed at Narita.</p>
