    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Living in San Francisco, we&rsquo;re spoiled when it comes to cocktails. Almost any bar you wander into could make a half-decent manhattan or gimlet. As <a href="/blog/2014/05/13/linz">I&rsquo;ve brought up before</a>, cocktails in Europe are a little lacking. Hampton and I wanted to find some decent mixed drinks, so did some research on the cocktail scene in Paris.</p>

<p>There are a handful of well-rated places, and we learnt that the first high-end cocktail bar to be successful was the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Experimental-Cocktail-Club/129531980432588">Experimental Cocktail Club</a> (&ldquo;ECC&rdquo;), which has been open for about six years. Apparently, a number of trainee bartenders from there have spread across the city, opening their own high-end cocktail bars. We went to three (alas, we didn&rsquo;t make it to the ECC).</p>

<p>We ended up at the similarly-named <a href="http://www.prescriptioncocktailclub.com/">Prescription Cocktail Club</a>, in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prescription+Cocktail+Club/@48.854997,2.337909,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9d147b310bda215">Saint Germain quarter</a>, as it was close to one of our favourite restaurants in Paris (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-la-boissonnerie-paris-2">Fish la Boissonnerie</a>). There was no obvious sign from the street that it was a cocktail bar, but we were pretty sure we had the right address. We peered in a window and saw a bunch of people sipping cocktails, so we went in. Although we showed up at 9pm on a Friday, we were lucky enough to get a table. The service was pretty good (there was table service at every bar we went to), and the cocktails were competent. I ordered something with gin, green Chartreuse, and crème de menthe. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but drinkable nontheless.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lemaryceleste.com/">Mary Celeste</a></p>

<p>The bizarrely-named <a href="http://www.sherrybuttparis.com/">Sherry Butt</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sherry+Butt/@48.853303,2.364085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e671ffaa10ef7d:0x2b98a01f163bffd1">not far from Bastille</a>, was probably my favourite cocktail bar that we went to. We went on a Thursday night and it was really quiet (being quiet is definitely a bonus for us). The bar was set up like a workshop – unfinished wood tables and odd contraptions on shelves. The menu was inventive and they seemed to produce a lot of their own syrups and flavourings for their drinks. Although they only listed their own concoctions, I asked for a Last Word and the bartender didn&rsquo;t hesitate to make one. The bartender was super-friendly and explained to us the cocktail scene in Paris – about how the &ldquo;ECC&rdquo; started it all, and that most of the high-end bartenders originated there. He was surprised we hadn&rsquo;t been to Candelaria, and strongly recommended we go there next.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candelariaparis.com/">Candelaria</a>, just <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Candelaria/@48.862981,2.364034,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfe5e1d4c40b38ec0">south of République</a>, is a pretty strange place. It reminded me of something you&rsquo;d find in San Francisco. From the street, it&rsquo;s a tiny, bright taqueria. There&rsquo;s one table and a handful of seats at a bar. At 9pm on a Thursday night, it was packed. People were spilling out onto the street, and we were told it would be a 30min wait if we wanted food. However, we were there for the cocktails.</p>

<p>If you squeeze past the people sitting at the diner-style bar, there&rsquo;s an unmarked door. Go through it and you&rsquo;re in a much larger room – although equally busy – lit by candles. The space was decorated with Day-of-the-Dead style skeletons and it really did feel like we were back in the Mission. Unfortunately, the cocktails were mediocre. We hadn&rsquo;t reserved a table ahead, so we were stuck standing elbow-to-elbow with the hipsters of Paris. It was a little clostrophobic in there.</p>

<p>We went to another cocktail bar/tapas restaurant nearby Candelaria: <a href="http://www.lemaryceleste.com/cocktails/">Le Mary Celeste</a>. As far as I know, the bartenders weren&rsquo;t ECC alumni, but they had a neat cocktail menu. The bar had a vaguely nautical theme, and the cocktails were refreshing – both on-menu and classics like a manhattan or a gimlet. If you&rsquo;re in the area, and want to get away from the intensity of Candelaria, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a good call.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that cocktails in Paris are expensive. €13 (~$18) was not unusual. Compare that to cocktails in San Francisco, where anything more than $12 would be considered pricey. It&rsquo;s a trade-off, obviously – the price of a baguette (80¢ or ~$1.10) or some great cheese is way less in Paris than in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy we found these places. Most were a little tricky to track down, but fun to drink at. It&rsquo;s good to know there are decent cocktial bars in Paris – even if you have to walk down a weird side-alley to get to them. I look forward to finding more next time we&rsquo;re in the city.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a quick trip to Jacksonville for my father-in-law&rsquo;s birthday, our next stop was Philadelphia. I had only visited Philadelphia by passing through its airport, and I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it as a city, so I was excited to spend a few days there. I was on my best behaviour and only made one joke about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia">it being sunny</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>Our first night we went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ranstead-room-philadelphia">the Ranstead Room</a>, at 20th and Ranstead. It&rsquo;s down an alley behind a modest black door.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Door to Ranstead Room</div>
</div>


<p>The cocktails were classics done well – try one of the fizzes if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start. The bartender was great at asking what you like and making something up. I got a Chartreuse and egg white drink (called the, uh, &ldquo;Chika Chika Boom Boom&rdquo;) that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>They serve food from the pared-down menu of their sister restaurant, El Rey. They had great tacos, plus some amazing popcorn with Jamaican spice that was both citrusy and umami.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Our delightful host</a> took us on a tour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City,_Philadelphia">Old City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_Hill,_Philadelphia">Society Hill</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_(Philadelphia)">South Street</a>. Old City and Society Hill have quaint colonial houses with a lot of history. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been living in San Francisco too long, but I was impressed with all the pre-1800 buildings.</p>

<p>We stopped in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jinxed-tuckers-digs-philadelphia">a neat store</a> that seemed to sell a lot of odd items (including lamps made out of what looked like spinal columns). On the way out, I looked down a small alley – <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@39.941169,-75.148958,3a,75y,102.7h,81.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sQadqWDkEoiNfRxrUPPZrGA!2e0">Kater St</a> – to see some incredible mosaic-murals.</p>

</div>


<p>The mosaics are the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Zagar">Isaiah Zagar</a>, who has around 200 mosaics in the South Street area of Philadelphia. They use a lot of mirror pieces and include quotations and the address of the place. They were mesmerising and I felt I could have spent hours sitting in front of them. Apparently there&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dream_(film)">a movie about him</a>, so I&rsquo;ll have to check that out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend more time in the South Street area of Philadelphia to find more of these murals.</p>

<h3>An aside:</h3>

<p>The amount of history in Philadelphia, especially regarding the founding of the United States and the beginning of the revolutionary war, was a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not ignorant of the history between the UK and the USA. Being British in the USA leads to good-natured ribbing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)">being a redcoat</a>. However, wandering around the centre of where the USA was founded and independence was sought is different. Everywhere there&rsquo;s information about how the revolutionaries were throwing off their repressive chains and seeking liberty. Implicit in all of the historical placards and explanatory signage was that they wanted to get away from the baddies. And in this case, the baddies were my ancestors (well, kinda).</p>

<p>I felt defensive, like I needed to stand up for my country: the UK wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad, was it? I&rsquo;m not a patriotic person, so feeling protective about my homeland was novel. I also felt conspicuous – that some tell would give me away, and people would be mad that the enemy was desecrating their site,  even though I was just standing there. I was sure I was only a moment away from being kicked out of the Constitution Museum or something.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really lived in another country, so I assume this is a pretty standard foreigner&rsquo;s paranoia. Maybe I should start wearing one of those sweet <a href="http://www.animalshirts.net/americanflagshirts/eaglefly.jpg">stars-and-stripes, eagle-soaring shirts</a> to blend in more.</p>

</div>


<p>At <a href="http://localeditionsf.com/">Local Edition</a> on Market at 3rd, there&rsquo;s a nice bourbon-based cocktail called the Brass Check. I think it&rsquo;s my favourite on their menu. The grapefruit comes through, but the syrup softens it so it&rsquo;s not too sour. The Rosebud is pretty good, too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Buffalo Trace Bourbon</li>
<li>Cyanar</li>
<li>Grapefruit</li>
<li>Lemon</li>
<li>Maple syrup</li>
<li>Strawberry</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you eat at a fancy restaurant (or at least a restaurant with a world-renowned chef), you have to get the weirdest thing on the menu. That chef (or restaurant) is famous for a reason &ndash; it creates flavour profiles that are going to be pleasing. So why waste your time on something standard?</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/cocktails/breakfast-of-champions.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Breakfast of Champions</div>
</div>


<p>That philosophy was how I ended up getting the Breakfast of Champions cocktail, pictured above, at <a href="http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/">ad hoc</a> the other weekend. Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>St George Botanivore gin</li>
<li>Fruit Loop-infused milk</li>
<li>Egg white</li>
</ul>


<p>It was so. bloody. delicious. In fact, I called the bartender over to congratulate him. The cocktail had only been on the menu for about a week, and he seemed chuffed with my praise. He even brought over some of the milk for us to try.</p>

<p>The cocktail itself was a more floral/fruity version of a standard sour drink. It wasn&rsquo;t too heavy and didn&rsquo;t have that gross milk aftertaste. It was seriously good. I must figure out how to make it at home.</p>

<p>Seriously, at nice restaurants always try something you think sounds gross.</p>
