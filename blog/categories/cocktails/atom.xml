    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida">Jacksonville</a>, Hampton&rsquo;s hometown, is pretty sprawling. As such, it&rsquo;s difficult to get to different areas of the city without driving. Thankfully, Uber recently arrived so you can drink and get home safely (although with all the recent controversy, I don&rsquo;t know how comfortable you might be with using Uber).</p>

<p>The main areas of town we went to were Downtown, San Marco, and Avondale.</p>

<p>In Downtown, I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="http://www.dosgatosjax.com/">Dos Gatos</a>. The cocktails are great and reasonably-priced.</p>

<p>San Marco has <a href="http://www.grapeandgrainexchange.com/">Grape and Grain Exchange</a>, with the Parlour in the back. Grape and Grain Exchange is an up-scale package store. They have a great range of liquors there – and we got some to drink at home. However it&rsquo;s worth grabbing a drink at the bar, too. The atmosphere is a little bright – it is primarily a shop, after all – but the cocktails are good. In the back there&rsquo;s the Parlour, which is a speakeasy-style bar. The service is pretty slow but they have some decent seasonal cocktails.</p>

<p>Avondale&rsquo;s top spot for drinking is <a href="http://www.mojobbq.com/mojo-no-4-urban-bbq-whiskey-bar">Mojo Nº4</a>. They have an extensive range of whiskey cocktails, all of which were tasty. Their Vieux Carré was great.</p>

<p>If Mojos is packed (and it often is, so get there early), try the <a href="http://mellowmushroom.com/store/avondale-jax">Mellow Mushroom</a> just across the street. Their pizza is pretty good, too, if you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>

<p>All in all, there&rsquo;s a few good spots around town if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent cocktail. Just make sure you have a taxi number handy to get home!</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/14/worlds-best-bars-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-14T14:18:22-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/10/14/worlds-best-bars-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/4841/Artesian_named_The_World_92s_50_Best_Bars_champion_2014.html">Drinks International&rsquo;s list of the top 50 cocktail bars</a> in the world. Sure, it&rsquo;s probably a list you can pay to appear on or whatever, but I love lists.</p>

<p>Turns out on our European trip we managed to hit six of them! So I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about my cocktail game.</p>

<ul>
<li>3 - <a href="/blog/2014/06/04/nightjar/">Nightjar</a>, London</li>
<li>12 - <a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/">Happiness Forgets</a>, London</li>
<li>17 - <a href="/blog/2014/05/24/cocktails-in-paris/">Candelaria</a>, Paris</li>
<li>24 - <a href="/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague/">Hemingway Bar</a>, Prague</li>
<li>26 - <a href="/blog/2014/08/09/amsterdam-food/">Door 74</a>, Amsterdam</li>
<li>49 - <a href="http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/welcome/">Callooh Callay</a>, London</li>
</ul>


<p>The only other one I&rsquo;d been to was #16, <a href="http://smugglerscovesf.com/trapdoor/">Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove</a>, in San Francisco. I still haven&rsquo;t been to #33, <a href="http://www.trickdogbar.com/">Trick Dog</a> – although it&rsquo;s been on my to-do list for a while. I&rsquo;ll probably head there as soon as I get back to SF.</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve only got two more nights in New York, I&rsquo;m not too sure we&rsquo;ll be able to hit the NYC ones on the list. But it&rsquo;s good to know they&rsquo;re out there.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2014-10-16)</strong>: Last night we went to number 5 on the list: <a href="http://www.employeesonlynyc.com/">Employees Only</a>, in New York&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Village">West Village</a>. It&rsquo;s a cool exterior – only a neon sign saying &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; indicates the location. There&rsquo;s a tiny room you go through that has a psychic doing tarot readings (if you should feel so inclined).</p>

<p>Inside it was packed. It&rsquo;s not a large space and most of the back is taken up with dining tables. The bar was two people deep (since when was Wednesday so packed?) and we were constantly being bustled by the waitstaff walking with food to tables nearer the front. There was no chance of getting a seat.</p>

<p>The drinks were OK – I got a Provençal and Hampton got the Billionaire Cocktail. Hampton&rsquo;s was way better; mine was a little bland, to be honest. Some subtle lavender flavour but that was about it. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy it there – and definitely don&rsquo;t think it deserves the number five spot.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Provençal (in front) and a Billionaire Cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s mainly due to atmosphere. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that if you&rsquo;re a fancy cocktail bar, seating-only is the way to go. Maybe that means you have to take reservations, but the overall experience is far better. For example, I had a much better time at <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk&amp;Honey</a>, where you sat down and the waitstaff helped you choose a drink.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the same reason I didn&rsquo;t enjoy Candelaria, in Paris, which is number 17 on the list. It was way too crowded and felt more like a sports bar during a Super Bowl than a nice cocktail place.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: (2014-11-05)</strong>: Milk &amp; Honey closed on the 25th October, according to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/milk-and-honey-new-york-3">the most recent Yelp review</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-30T08:36:49-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/30/some-ninth-avenue-bars</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post has an awkward title. That&rsquo;s chiefly because the bars in New York are so numerous that I couldn&rsquo;t claim knowledge of even 0.1 percent. I couldn&rsquo;t even claim to have exhausted bars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a> (our current neighbourhood), or even the Ninth Avenue bit of Chelsea. In fact, a more accurate title for this post would be &ldquo;Bars Between 20th and 17th Streets on Ninth Avenue: A Small Sampling.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange coming from Prague, where we managed to check off almost all of the decent cocktail bars in the centre, to a city where we&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been trying out some of the recommended bars in the area. We haven&rsquo;t found a bar we&rsquo;re completely comfortable with – the nice mix of decent cocktails and relaxed atmosphere has eluded us so far in Chelsea.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tipsyparson.com/">Tipsy Parson</a> is a great restaurant as well as a pretty good cocktail bar. You know how often, a Southern-style restaurant can&rsquo;t beat the food you actually get in the South? Well, that&rsquo;s not the case here. I had fried catfish with gravy, and Hampton had shrimp and grits. Both were great – the catfish was crisp and the gravy wasn&rsquo;t too peppery (which happens a lot with Southern gravy).</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Shrimp and grits</div>
</div>


<p>Looking at the menu, we spotted the head chef&rsquo;s name: Ty-Lör Boring. That&rsquo;s quite an unusual na- wait, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/people/ty-lor-boring/bio"><em>that</em> Ty-Lör</a>, from Top Chef?! It was!</p>

<p>They also have seats at the bar. The cocktails are a little bit hit and miss. They&rsquo;re trying hard to be inventive, but a lot of them miss the mark. There was a ginger-based drink that was <em>way</em> too gingery, even for me. The Professor Plum was pretty good, although due to seasonal changes of the menu I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s available any more.</p>

</div>


<p><a href="http://bathtubginnyc.com/">Bathtub Gin</a> is a speakeasy behind a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s quite conspicuous for a speakeasy – walking past on a Saturday night you see a line of people outside an empty coffee bar. I&rsquo;m no fool! No coffee is that tasty. We booked for 6pm on a quiet night and even then the bouncer made us wait outside, despite it being empty when we were eventually let in.</p>

<p>The drinks were quite good. We started out with a Martini and a Blushing Lady #2.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Blushing Lady #2</div>
</div>


<p>The Blushing Lady #2 tasted like a sour grape candy. The Martini was OK. The secound round proved better – a Vesper and a Last Word.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Last Word</div>

<p>They had some great small plates to share – the mushroom gnocchi was my favourite. The pork belly sliders were also super-tasty.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Pork belly sliders</div>
</div>


<p>The staff were a little stand-offish, which I&rsquo;m getting tired of when it comes to fancy speakeasy-style bars. Bourbon &amp; Branch in SF has a similar problem. (<em>Update</em>: we went to the speakeasy <a href="http://www.mlkhny.com/newyork/">Milk and Honey</a> and the staff there were delightful. The drinks were great too!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php">La Bottega</a> is in a crazy-looking hotel called the Maritime. Its windows are all circular, and it&rsquo;s sides are sloped inwards. The drinks there are OK, but not very well balanced. The Vesper tasted like pure vodka; the Manhattan was almost pure vermouth.</p>

<p>Some other bars we&rsquo;ve been to in the Chelsea area (but not on 9th) are <a href="http://www.theparknyc.com/">The Park</a>, on 10th avenue, and <a href="http://heartwoodnyc.com/">Heartwood</a>, on 8th.</p>

<p>The Park is in a beautiful converted parking garage, with an indoor &ldquo;garden&rdquo; area. The front bar was pretty crowded, so we sat in the garden area where – pro-tip – there&rsquo;s a secret back bar! We ordered drinks from both and the back bartender was way better. Plus there was no wait at the back bar.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/nyc/ninth-ave-bars/hendricks-mash.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/nyc/ninth-ave-bars/hendricks-mash.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Hendrick&#8217;s Mash</div>
</div>


<p>Heartwood is on 8th Avenue, between 20th and 19th. I ordered a couple of drinks there and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy them – one was my fault, the other the bartender&rsquo;s. The menu had sections, one of which was classifed as &ldquo;Shrubs.&rdquo; Not being familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_(drink)">drink called a shrub</a>, I picked one with gin in it. Turns out, they really do put vinegar in them. It was surprising on first taste, then just became kinda throat-burning. I love vinegar, but drinking it is a little difficult. Anyway, I put that mistake down to me, and not the bar itself. However, I then ordered a Last Word and they missed out the lime. That makes it a little undrinkable – just sweet and herbal. My first drink was too acidic, my next not acidic enough. There&rsquo;s no pleasing me.</p>

<p>Anyway, SassConf has started and I&rsquo;ll no doubt be writing about that as the week goes on.</p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/20/bar-chef/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-20T09:10:44-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/20/bar-chef</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>We&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.worldsbestbars.com/">World&#8217;s Best Bars</a> to find bars when we&#8217;ve been travelling. It&#8217;s a little hit-and-miss, and you need to do some extra research before you randomly pick one. But it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re in a place that doesn&#8217;t really use Yelp or FourSquare. We showed it to Mike and Melissa, and they laughed at a lot of the choices for Toronto. One, however, they recommended: <a href="http://www.barcheftoronto.com/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Bar Chef</span></a>.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s in the second-coolest neighbourhood in the world (according to <a href="http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/1080625/fifteen-coolest-street-style-neighborhoods/">Vogue</a>) – Queen Street West. They serve fancy cocktails and want to &#8220;challenge the [&#8230;] cocktail experience.&#8221; SOUNDS FUN!</p>

  <p>Oh, it was dark inside, so most of my photos are a little grainy. Sorry.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/barchef.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/barchef.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Bar Chef placemat</div>
  </div>

  <p>We started out with two normal-ish cocktails. The Symphony No 5 was a gin/vanilla thing that was OK. The Basil Daiquiri was tasty – super-drinkable.

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/symphony-daiquiri.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/symphony-daiquiri.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Symphony No. 5 and the Basil Daiquiri</div>
  </div>

  <p>These two cocktails were pretty good. However, we noticed there was a &#8220;modernist&#8221; section that had more expensive ones – some with some weird ingredients (&#8220;spring fog&#8221;? &#8220;beach essence&#8221;?).</p>

  <p>Hampton got a $45 (!) Manhattan. It came under a giant cloche filled with smoke.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan-cloche.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan-cloche.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Cloche full of smoke</div>
  </div>

  <p>It rested on the table for a minute or two before the bartender came over and slowly swirled the cloche off the top of the pedestal. Underneath was the smokey Manhattan!</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/manhattan.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Manhattan</div>
  </div>

  <p>It was seriously smokey. Even though I was only sat next to Hampton, my clothes smelt like a wood fire for the next day.</p>

  <p>The next modernist cocktail we got was the Black Truffle. It came with six tiny spoons. The spoons had a coconut foam/lime dust mixture on them. You were supposed to eat one of those, then drink the gin-based concoction. Those spoons were amazing, and they went well with the drink. The drink had elderflower in it, too, so I loved it.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/black-truffle.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">Black Truffle</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next up, there was a Cedar. It came on a wood platter set up like a zen garden. There was a sprig of cedar in one corner, some cacao &#8220;soil&#8221; and chunks of pear. You dip the pear in the &#8220;soil,&#8221; and eat that before you drink. I didn&#8217;t get much from the food bit, but the drink (a gin-chamomile-pear thing) was clean and fresh.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/cedar.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/cedar.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Cedar</div>
  </div>

  <p>I think the weirdest drink of the night was the Spring Thaw. It came in a tiny glass surrounded by moss. The bartender came over and poured water (?) over the moss, and it started misting. I&#8217;m guessing there was perfumed dry ice in there somewhere – it smelled just like a spring forest.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/spring-thaw-mist.jpg">
      <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/spring-thaw-mist.jpg">
    </a>
    <div class="alt">Spring thawing all over the table</div>
  </div>

  <p>The cocktail itself was a gin-campari thing. It had a campari sorbet of some kind, and as you were drinking the sorbet melted into the rest. It&#8217;s a neat concept, but it was strange that the drink got more and more bitter as you went on.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/barchef/spring-thaw.jpg">

    </a>
    <div class="alt">The Spring Thaw cocktail itself</div>
  </div>

  <p>We also got a punch bowl, which I&#8217;d recommend if you&#8217;re tired of the pomp around the other cocktails.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">I love any kind of ceremony or ostentation around food and drink. There&#8217;s something fun about the process – in these cases, eating something special before you drink, or smelling a fog that surrounds your glass. So I&#8217;m already inclined to like a place like this – and I did. A lot. It&#8217;s definitely not cheap, though, and certainly not a casual after-work-drinks kinda place.</span></p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/10/north-korean-brandy-cocktail/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-10T08:24:50-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/09/10/north-korean-brandy-cocktail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We made it to Toronto! But more on that later. What&rsquo;s more important is drinking unusual alcohol. While in Toronto, we&rsquo;ve been hanging out with two of our awesome friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/mferrier">Mike</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">Melissa</a>. Last year, they visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ</a>, and <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=6587">bought a bottle of North Korean brandy</a> known as Paekrosul.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/paekrosul.jpg">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/paekrosul.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Paekrosul</div>
</div>


<p>Apparently its name translates as <a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/nieminen/chiew.html">&ldquo;Hundred-Years Liquour&rdquo;</a>, which is certainly promising.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/made-in-dprk.jpg">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">For realz made in DPR Korea</div>
</div>


<p>The bottle was a little tatty, and it was stoppered with a plastic cork. Inside, there was a bit of sandy sediment. Feeling the risk of going blind was one worth taking, we opened the bottle and poured ourselves a (small) glass.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/toronto/dprk/glass.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Paekrosul, neat</div>
</div>


<p>I thought it smelled a lot like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu">baiju</a>, a Chinese liquour that my Dad always gets as a business gift. Others described it as having more of a turpentine aroma.</p>

<p>Despite its nose-burning smell, it tasted fine. Harsh at first, it quickly becomes sweeter and it didn&rsquo;t have a burning aftertaste that you get with a lot of high-proof drinks. No one really wanted to drink much more than a sip, though. What do you do when you have alcohol that no one&rsquo;s going to drink neat? You make a cocktail of course!</p>

<p>Mike and Melissa have a well-stocked bar, so I had a lot of stuff to work with. But where to begin? I looked online for some brandy cocktails to see if I could modify them. One suggestion was the <a href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/mtropltn_cktl.htm">metropolitan</a> – like a manhattan but with brandy instead of whiskey. I used one part sweet vermouth to three parts Paekrosul, plus some Angostura for good measure. It didn&rsquo;t taste that great, though. As the Paekrosul was sweet already, the vermouth didn&rsquo;t contribute much. Plus the main off-putting thing about Paekrosul was the smell. Neither the vermouth nor the bitters covered that up. Time to try a different route.</p>

<p>My favourite cocktails are all citrus-based. Citrus fruits also tend to have pretty strong aromas, so I thought using lemon or lime might be good.</p>

<p>I mixed in some lemon juice and it tasted pretty good. It tasted even better if you used a lemon peel as a garnish. Twisting the peel to spray the citrus oil over the drink covered up the turpentine smell pretty well.</p>

<p>I tried it with lime but it didn&rsquo;t work as well – the lime flavour wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p>

<p>I also ended up adding some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointreau">Cointreau triple sec</a> to the mix to add a little more citrus and sweetness.</p>

<p>Ta-da! It wasn&rsquo;t the best cocktail I&rsquo;ve ever made, but I think I did a good job of mostly masking the worst flavours of the Paekrosul while keeping its more distinctive flavours. I&rsquo;m pretty sure by next summer it will be on every speakeasy menu from Brooklyn to the Mission.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t come up with a witty name yet, so suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>If you have some Paekrosul , is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 parts Paekrosul</li>
<li>1 part Triple Sec</li>
<li>1 part lemon juice</li>
<li>Stir over ice, serve with an ice cube and lemon peel garnish.</li>
</ul>
