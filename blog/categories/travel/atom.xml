    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaiscool">good friend</a> converted us to <a href="http://melissadreamsofsushi.com/?p=7432">always packing carry-ons</a> when going on trips. It&rsquo;s far easier to travel with a carry-on – especially when taking low-cost airlines that charge to check luggage.</p>

<p>The longest we have spent living out of a carry-on has been about three months. The benefits definitely outweighed the negatives. If we ran out of clothes, we could often find laundry facilities. Anything we forgot could usually be bought locally. So, for this trip we took the plunge and aimed to pack only a carry-on for seven months of travel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to pack for seven months in a carry-on when you&rsquo;re travelling during summer. No hats, scarves, gloves, or bulky coats are necessary. Of course, when we make it back to the East Coast it will be autumn and may be a little chilly. At that point, we can easily buy warmer clothes (as <a href="https://twitter.com/hcatlin/status/458307183470342144">Hampton pointed out</a>, clothes tend to be more expensive in Europe).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Choosing things to pack was pretty simple. I went through T-shirts I liked and grabbed them. One pair of darker jeans (that could work in a nicer restaurant) is useful. Shirts that look good without needing to be ironed are helpful if you need a dressier option and don&rsquo;t have an iron handy.</p>

<p>I also made sure to pack some older clothes, too, so I could throw things out if necessary.</p>

<p>Getting it into the suitcase was simple by rolling everything up. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/06/business/businessspecial/20100506-pack-ss.html?_r=0">the &ldquo;roll&rdquo; style of packing</a>, it&rsquo;s excellent and allows you to fit a lot more in a suitcase (and keep things mostly wrinkle-free).</p>

<p>The two images above contain about two weeks' worth of clothes. Making sure I wear bulky items when travelling means that the lighter versions (e.g. a lighter jacket, thinner shoes) fit in the suitcase. The contact lenses should be <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/medically-necessary-liquids">allowed as medical liquids</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 polo shirt</li>
<li>3 shirts</li>
<li>11 regular socks</li>
<li>7 ankle socks</li>
<li>16 pairs of underwear</li>
<li>2 pairs of trousers</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts</li>
<li>1 pair of swimming trunks</li>
<li>2 pairs of shoes (one boot-like, one light and foldable)</li>
<li>2 jackets (one light, one heavy)</li>
<li>1 toothbrush</li>
<li>1 razor</li>
<li>1 pair of sunglasses</li>
<li>90 pairs of contact lenses</li>
<li>1 international adaptor</li>
</ul>


<p>Our laptop bags will have toiletries (shaving cream, toothpaste and deodorant only – everything else we can buy as we need it), our laptops, kindles, and chargers.</p>

<p>And there you go. That&rsquo;s how you pack for seven months in only carry-on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the next seven months, Hampton and I will be travelling around Europe and the East Coast. We have few solid plans aside from some conferences (<a href="http://codefront.io/">Codefront.io</a>, <a href="http://2014.la-conf.org/">La Conf</a>, <a href="http://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a> and <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a>).</p>

<p>A friend gave me the idea to blog as we travel. I&rsquo;ve been lax with this blog recently, and I hope that switching platforms (from WordPress to Octopress) will spur me to write more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first post on SF was a bit tourist-y. This one will be more focused on food and drink. And other funstuff.</p>

<p>We ate at a neat burger place on Union Sq &ndash; the aptly-named <a href="http://www.burger-bar.com/">Burger Bar</a>.</p>

<p>The milkshakes (picture missing) were amazing. The nutella one was just ice-cream and nutella, pretty much. The burger was good&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve had better (I&rsquo;m looking at you, The Bird in Berlin.)</p>

<p>We went to an awesome beach &ndash; China Beach. It was really quiet and had insane views of the Golden Gate and its bridge.</p>

<p>Oh, and something else I&rsquo;d highly recommend is Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It&rsquo;s on every Thursday and has a general theme every week (we went for 80s nostalgia/comedy). They have booze, you can wander around the exhibits, and they play pretty awesome music.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all I have to say. If you keep track of my whereabouts, you&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve now moved to San Francisco to live. It&rsquo;s awesome here!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After Jacksonville, we headed on to San Francisco. Hampton&rsquo;s company (Moovweb) is based there.</p>

<p>We flew United 2623 from CLT to SFO. They had WIFI!!!!! Zomg. It&rsquo;s still a novelty for me. I don&rsquo;t have many photos of the CLT-SFO flight, just the food pretty much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been to San Francisco before, so it was a bit of an adventure. We only spent a couple of days doing touristy things, and the rest of the time was mostly Hampton working at Moovweb and me working on the book. Here&rsquo;s some tourist photos.</p>

<p>One of the best views for the whole two weeks was from the GrandViews lounge in the Grand Hyatt. The cocktails were OK, the food in the neighbouring restaurant the same, but the views&hellip; wow. This was at sunset. You can see the TransAm building and Coit Tower from this angle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So&hellip; I really need to start blogging about an amazing trip I&rsquo;ve been on. It&rsquo;s been going for about two months now. It started in July, when we moved out of our apartment in Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve visited seven cities, from Honolulu to Berlin. It&rsquo;ll probably take me a while to blog about them all. Here&rsquo;s a brief itinerary:</p>

<p>LGW &ndash; TPA (25th July 2011)</p>

<p>JAX &ndash; CLT &ndash; SFO (8th August 2011)</p>

<p>SFO &ndash; HNL &ndash; KOA (23rd August 2011)</p>

<p>KOA &ndash; HNL (30th August 2011)</p>

<p>HNL &ndash; LAX &ndash; LHR (1st September 2011)</p>

<p>LTN &ndash; SXF (8th September 2011)</p>

<p>SXF &ndash; FCO (23rd September 2011)</p>

<p>VCE &ndash; LGW (2nd October 2011)</p>
