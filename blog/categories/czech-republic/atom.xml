    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">

  <p>I'd read recently about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe">absinthe</a> was having a resurgence in popularity, especially in Prague. While we're here, we decided to book a tasting with <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Absinthe Prague</span></a>.</p>

  <p>I'd had absinthe before in London, and I remembered enjoying it despite not liking anise-flavoured things. I was looking forward to tasting a range of absinthes to see if I could taste any differences.</p>

  <p>The tasting itself is in the basement of <a href="http://groovebar.cz/">Groove Bar</a>, a trendy cocktail bar <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Groove+Bar/@50.080446,14.416966,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b94f1c418d2a1:0xe8a4fa7d2309d51f">just off the river</a>. The host is Aaron Johns, an ex-pat living in Prague who definitely knows his stuff – both about absinthe and beer (he runs a <a href="http://tastelocalbeer.com/">local beer tour</a>, too). He gave a lot of interesting history on absinthe, most of which I had no clue about. He explained in detail all about how it's made, why it's made that way, and even about the ban. He was great at answering questions, too.</p>

  <p>The ritual of drinking absinthe was enjoyable to learn about and even more fun to do – the sugar cube, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo_effect">louche</a>, the absinthe spoon all came together to produce a great experience. You get a little absinthe in a glass, then balance the spoon over the top. Then you place a sugar cube on the spoon and drip ice-cold water onto the sugar until there's a ratio of about five parts water to one part absinthe. As you drip the water in, the absinthe goes from clear to cloudy (the "louche"). At that point it's ready to drink.</p>

  <p>The tasting covered six absinthes – two each from France, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. They all had unique characters and it was a lot of fun comparing notes with what others thought.</p>

  <div class="img">

    <div class="alt">The absinthes we tasted</div>
  </div>

  <p>We started out with a Swiss "le bleu" style – it was colourless rather than the vivid green usually associated with absinthe. During the louche it had a slight blue tint to it. The anise flavour was pretty strong, and that put me off a little.</p>

  <p>We then moved onto two "classic" absinthes – one French and one Swiss. They were both heavier on the wormwood, and less on the anise flavour. The French one, made by Pernod, was quite nice. The <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/absinthe-roquette-1797/">Roqeutte 1797</a> was apparently based on a recipe from the original inventor of absinthe. It had a really complex palate, having hints of citrus as well as the other anise/wormwood flavours. It was a little intense for me.</p>

  <p>My two favourites were the unconventional absinthes. Both produced in the Czech Republic, one was based on a honey liquor and one was from an American recipe. The honey one didn't even need sugar added, and it went down really smoothly. It almost tasted like a cocktail. The American-recipe absinthe, <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/absinthe-butterfly/">Butterfly</a> had almost a gin-like flavour.</p>

  <p>The last absinthe was French: <a href="http://absinthe-prague.com/products/la-grenouille-by-zufanek/">La Grenouille</a>. I was glad it was saved to the end, cause it had a very intense flavour.</p>

  <p>We ended up learning a lot about absinthe (such as what absinthe actually means, and the difference between absinthe and absinth) – it was a super-entertaining evening. The pours weren't too heavy, so we weren't blasted by the time we finished. It also gave both Hampton and me a deeper appreciation (and understanding) of the drink. In fact, the next night, we both ordered absinthe off the menu.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">Absinthe Prague is great, and something you should definitely do if you're seeking out a unique, informative evening with some tasty spirits.</span></p>

    <link href="http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/07/day-trip-to-kutna-hora/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-07T17:44:03+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/07/day-trip-to-kutna-hora</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prague has excellent rail connections to many smaller cities and towns in the Czech Republic. Taking day (or weekend) trips, especially if you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for an extended time, is pretty easy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a> was our first destination.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cd.cz/en/">website for the Czech rail system</a> is great – it gave detailed times and information on the trains, all in English. From Prague, there were direct trains to Kutná Hora every two hours or so. As our timing didn&rsquo;t line up, we took a train to Kolín, then transferred. Pro tip: jot down the final destination of your planned train. It won&rsquo;t be Kutná Hora! We ended up just following the other tourists. The journey took about an hour total, and ended up at Kutná Hora hl. n., the main train station in the town. (The journey back was a bit worse, but more on that later.)</p>

<p>Kutná Hora hl. n is close (about a 10 minute walk) to the Sedlec end of the town. In Sedlec (a small suburb of Kutná Hora) are two famous sites: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlec_Ossuary">Sedlec Ossuary</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Assumption_of_Our_Lady_and_Saint_John_the_Baptist">Church of the Assumption of Our Lady</a>. I&rsquo;d heard of the Ossuary before, and that was the main reason we were in the town.</p>

<p>Getting to the ossuary was pretty simple – there were some signs pointing in the right direction (follow those labelled &ldquo;Kostnice&rdquo;). When you get to the ossuary, you can buy a ticket for up to four attractions: the ossuary and the Church of Our Lady (both in Sedlec), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Barbara%27s_Church,_Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Church of St Barbara</a> and the Jesuit College (in the Kutná Hora town centre). The Jesuit College was closed on Mondays so we didn&rsquo;t go. The admission was 160CK (~$8) for the three attractions.</p>

<p>The ossuary was neat. It was a lot smaller than I was expecting – basically one room, with a tonne of bones. It was creepy, but the number of tourists taking photos in there made it feel more like a room in the <a href="http://dedicatedtodlp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/potc-queue1.jpg">Pirates of the Caribbean queue</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/kutna-hora/bones.png">
  <div class="alt">Bones, skull and crossbones, bone chandelier, bone signature.</div>
</div>


<p>They hand out laminated sheets with some information on them, so you get a little historical information. However, I&rsquo;d recommend either loading up Wikipedia or having it on your phone for more detail.</p>

<div class="img">

  <div class="alt">Coat of Arms in bones, cause, y'know, why not?</div>
</div>


<p>After the ossuary, we went to the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. We were the only people in there. It was a little strange – I&rsquo;ve not really been in a Gothic-looking cathedral where all the walls are painted beige/yellow.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>


<p>Aside from a couple of <a href="http://www.onestepinto.com/gallery/Kutna%20Hora/DSC_4303_Kutna_OSI.jpg">garishly-dressed relics</a> it was pretty dull. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend going but it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste as you walk right by it heading into town from the ossuary.</p>

<p>There are supposedly a number of buses that go from the ossuary into the centre, but we decided we&rsquo;d walk it. The best thing I can say about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sedlec+Ossuary,+Z%C3%A1meck%C3%A1,+284+03+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/St+Barbara's+Church,+Barborsk%C3%A1,+284+01+Kutn%C3%A1+Hora,+Czech+Republic/@49.9533462,15.2670308,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c40fc635ac54f:0x320cc9caa5f1508e!2m2!1d15.288043!2d49.961782!1m5!1m1!1s0x470c41a6cd710ae9:0xa19ced0f3eeca1db!2m2!1d15.26362!2d49.944911!3e2">the walk from Sedlec into Kutná Hora proper</a> is that it was about 40 minutes and got us a fair few steps on our fitbits. The walk is mainly through industrial and suburban parts of the town, and for the most part there&rsquo;s not much to look at. However, once you get into the centre itself, Kutná Hora is gorgeous.</p>

<p>There are a number of winding cobblestone back-streets with beautiful buildings. I think we could have spent a few hours just wandering around the town. We had a quick lunch at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274701-d1570760-Reviews-Restaurant_Cafe_Harmonia-Kutna_Hora_Central_Bohemian_Region_Bohemia.html">Café Harmonia</a>, which had amazing gnocchi. Then we headed for the next church on our list: St Barbara&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The walk up to the cathedral was beautiful – there&rsquo;s a promenade-type thing with statues along it that reminded us of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>From the promenade you get a great view looking over Kutná Hora.</p>

<p>Inside, St Barbara&rsquo;s was amazing. Much better than the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady.</p>

</div>


<p>There were a few stained glass windows from the 1910s, which were neat. The one which I found interesting was from 2013. I find modern stained glass intriguiging as it&rsquo;s not really a standard modern art form (aside from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_%26_George">Gilbert and George</a>).</p>

<p>After we had explored the cathedral, we started our journey back to Prague. Rather than walk the 40 minutes back to Kutná Hora hl. n., we went to the station in the centre of town – Kutná Hora město. It&rsquo;s tiny and rural, without any real platforms. There&rsquo;s a shuttle train that runs between this station and the main station. When we arrived, the next train was in 40 minutes(!), and we didn&rsquo;t have much choice but to wait for it. We changed at the main station to a train to Kolín. From Kolín to Prague we ended up on the Berlin train, an EC-class train. It was slightly nicer than the R-class we took on the way there, but not by much. It ended up taking us about two hours for the return journey. I&rsquo;d recommend timing your trip back carefully.</p>

<p>All in all it was a pretty nice day trip. If you&rsquo;re travelling around the Czech Republic, or you&rsquo;re staying in Prague for a while and want to get out of the city, it&rsquo;s a fun thing to do.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-01T14:43:53+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/07/01/prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many people say how much they like Prague. I&rsquo;ve also heard many people say how much charm Prague has lost since the mid-90s, how it&rsquo;s now filled with tourists. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to expect. Would it be inviting and elegant, or a tourist-trap nightmare?</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve been here for three weeks, and I can safely say we both love the city. We love it so much we&rsquo;re planning on extending our time here until the end of July. It&rsquo;s got a mix of many things we enjoy about other European cities: the architectural beauty of Paris, the efficient transit of Berlin, the edginess (and cheapness) of Gdańsk. Plus, as I <a href="/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague">mentioned previously</a>, it has great cocktails.</p>

<p>The first seven days we were here, four nights had fireworks displays. There was a <a href="http://unitedislands.cz/">free music festival</a> the other weekend. There was <a href="http://www.prazskamuzejninoc.cz/">Prague Museum Night</a>, where museums stayed open until late at night. There&rsquo;s usually an open-air concert on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/St%C5%99eleck%C3%BD+ostrov/@50.08048,14.410501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x20fab08b45c47614">this island in the Vltava</a>. It seems like there&rsquo;s always something happening, and I think that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons we&rsquo;ve been drawn to Prague as a livable city.</p>

<p>Having said all of that&hellip; there are a tonne of tourists in certain areas – and this is where I maybe see why some people say Prague has lost its charm. We are (thankfully) staying about 10 minutes' walk from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square_(Prague)">Old Town Square</a>. We can easily get there if we want to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Orloj">Astronomical Clock</a> chime, but we&rsquo;re not trapped by the tourists.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/oldtownsq.jpg">
  <div class="alt">All the tourists, ever</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s overwhelming, for sure. Cross into the Old Town and you pretty much hear only English being spoken. If you&rsquo;re thinking of staying in Prague, I&rsquo;d try and avoid that area if possible. The city is extremely walkable, so staying a little outside the centre shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. We&rsquo;re just south of Národní, which is perfect.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve jotted down some thoughts on the tourist-type stuff we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first thing we did, and the first thing I&rsquo;d suggest doing, is a self-guided walking tour. I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly impressed with the Rick Steves walking tours we&rsquo;ve done in previous cities, and his <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/eastern-europe">Prague city walk tour</a> was no different. The tour is available as a free podcast and takes about two or three hours. The recording itself is just over one hour, but we stopped in museums and cafés as we went.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/ourladyoftyn.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Listening to Rick in the Old Town Square</div>
</div>


<p>The tour covers a lot of the history of not just Prague, but the Czech Republic as a whole. I was completely ignorant of the recent history of the country and found the descriptions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Palach">Jan Palach&rsquo;s suicide</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution">Velvet Revolution</a> quite stirring. You end up seeing all the main sights of Prague, which is great to orientate yourself. You can then go back and check out places that you find interesting on a different day (or stop along the way, as we did).</p>

<p>Another pretty common tourist thing to visit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_castle">Prague Castle</a>, which you can see from most places in Prague. We decided to foolishly climb up. I would not recommend it – it&rsquo;s a pretty steep climb. Take transit there instead!</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/viewfromcastle.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Those are the steps we had to climb up</div>
</div>


<p>The castle itself is apparently one of the largest castle complexes in the world. It&rsquo;s the seat of the President of the Czech Republic and has a bunch of government offices too. It&rsquo;s pretty cool, but&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it if you&rsquo;re only here for a couple of days.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ticket options – one has four of the major sights, the other has all ten of them. We went for the four-sight option, which was plenty. The audioguides were all out of battery (?!) when we went on a Monday, so that meant we didn&rsquo;t get quite as much information out of our visit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vitus_Cathedral">St Vitus' Cathedral</a> was the highlight by a long shot. It had some gorgeous art nouveau stained glass windows.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/stvitusstainedglass.jpg">
  <div class="alt">Stained glass windows by Alphonse Mucha</div>
</div>


<p>The other attractions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Basilica,_Prague">St George&rsquo;s Basilica</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Royal_Palace_(Prague)">Old Royal Palace</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lane">Golden Lane</a>) were&hellip; not as impressive. The Basilica had some interesting old murals, the Old Royal Palace had the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations_of_Prague">defenestration</a> window. Golden Lane was just a bunch of tourist shops, so I&rsquo;m not sure why it was included as an &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; in the ticket price.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn">Petřín Hill</a> is another imposing feature on the Prague skyline. We took the funicular to the top, which Hampton enjoyed because he loves funiculars. Apart from that, there wasn&rsquo;t much up there. Looking at the hill, it&rsquo;s covered in trees. We didn&rsquo;t quite realise that that meant there&rsquo;d be no view from the top of the hill. All you can see from up there is forest, pretty much. You could pay 100K or so (~$5) to go up a replica of the Eiffel Tower, which I&rsquo;m sure had better views, but we decided to spend our money instead on an old mirror maze.</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/houseofmirrors.jpg">
  <div class="alt">19th century mirror maze</div>
</div>


<p>The walk down is pleasant, so if it&rsquo;s a nice day I&rsquo;d recommend taking a trip.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all the tourist stuff we have done. Like I said, we&rsquo;ve mostly enjoyed the non-tourist stuff here. It&rsquo;s a great city to explore, especially with the number of parks for lazing and the random outdoor concerts we&rsquo;ve experienced. A great site we&rsquo;ve been using is <a href="http://www.expats.cz/">Expats.cz</a>, which has a list of events going on every day.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-20T11:38:18+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.malrase.com/blog/2014/06/20/hemingway-bar-prague</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div itemprop="description">
  <p>We've been in Prague for just over a quarter of our month-long stay. So far, it's treated us well. I'll write a longer post about thoughts on Prague (and the Czech Republic) later on, but first to more important things: cocktails.</p>

  <p>Due to other European cities lacking decent cocktail bars, we didn't have high hopes for Prague. Although we eventually found some in Paris, that was after a fair bit of research and travelling to the other side of the city. Would Prague be any different? Additionally, the first thing anyone says about the Czech Republic is that you'll never want for beer – it's cheap, good quality, and plentiful. Was there any room for a good whiskey sour?</p>

  <p>In short: yes. There are a surprising number of decent cocktail bars within five minutes' walk of our just-out-of-centre apartment. Most of them do standard cocktails as well as some of their own invention. So far, <a href="http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hemingway Bar</span></a> is probably my favourite.</p>

  <p>It's on one of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&cid=2095651347638903815&q=Hemingway+Bar&ei=cQSkU-TBPMrsO6zsgJAH&ved=0CKkBEPwSMA4">narrow winding streets of Old Town</a>, just off the river – so it makes for a nice walk, especially at dusk with the lights of the castle just coming on.</p>

    <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/castle_dusk.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Sunset over the Vltava</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bar itself is cosy, with three or four small rooms spread over two floors. Pictures of Hemingway line all the walls, as do various drinking vessels – most of which seem to be actually used for drinks.</p>

  <p>The best cocktail (and the one Hampton keeps going back to) is the Red Carpet. It's like an old fashioned/whiskey sour/manhattan mix-up. It's delicious and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Oh, and it comes served on a little square of red carpet. Cute.</p>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://www.malrase.com/images/the-journey/prague/hemingway/redcarpet.jpg">
    <div class="alt">Red Carpet</div>
  </div>

 <p> I had a gin-lillet cocktail that was also pretty refreshing (maybe it was just because it was 32ºC outside?). With a name like "Corpse Reviver," I thought I'd be getting something throat-burning, but it was really smooth.</p>

  <div class="img">

    <div class="alt">Corpse Reviver Nº2</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next adorable drink: a martinez using Earl Grey-infused gin. It came in a teacup with a biscuit to nibble on. Perfect!</p>

  </div>

  <p>Hampton got the Nick Adams Penicilin, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Adams_(character)">a character in a number of Hemingway's short stories</a>. It came on a tray with a glass of ice, a small aspirin-shaped sweet, a bottle of lemon/honey/whisky, and an Erlenmeyer flask of 10-year malt whisky. We were instructed to pour the bottle over the ice, then float the 10-year malt over the top. It was fun! Also get the Hemingway's New Fashioned if you're into process-heavy drinks with multiple components.</p>

  <p>Onto one strange thing that happened. Have you ever ordered an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Car_Bomb">Irish Car Bomb</a>? I'm assuming that most people reading this aren't frat boys, so I'm going to guess most said "no." Anyway, the first time I heard someone talk about it I was shocked. Needless to say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a> are a very recent, violent, and real part of my country's history. Having a drink named after such a thing is hideous and offensive.</p>

  <p>What's this rant got to do with the bar? Well, as part of Gin Fest, occuring this week in Prague, they had a special cocktail. It was called "The Bronx." I was recommended it by the bartender, so I got it. It came on a graffiti coaster and a pipette filled with a dark liquid. The bartender squirted the liquid on top of the drink and explained with a cheeky grin that it represented blood.</p>

  <p>Was this a drink facetiously referencing gang violence? The bartender seemed to think it was pretty clever. I was just bewildered. For what it's worth, though, it didn't taste bad.</p>

  <p>There were a number of other cocktails I didn't take photos of, but were delicious. Their Lavender Martini was great, and they had the first whiskey sour to rival my favourite (from the Dogpatch Saloon or 83 Proof in San Francisco). In fact, they have a fair few drinks on the menu with egg whites, which I'm a sucker for.</p>
