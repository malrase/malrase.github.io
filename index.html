  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was my birthday a couple of days ago, and I got a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Hotel#The_Savoy_Cocktail_Book">The Savoy Cocktail Book</a>. It&rsquo;s been in publication since 1930, with over 700 recipes inside.</p>

<p>To be honest, a lot of the recipes are very similar. Most are based on whiskey, rum, or dry gin. Then, you add varying amounts of sweet and dry vermouths (called Italian and French vermouths, respectively) – plus dashes of bitters or other liqueurs.</p>

<p>The presentation is top-notch, though, with gorgeous art deco illustrations every few pages. Check out the page where the Savoy Cocktail is presented.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/cocktails/savoy-pages.jpg">
    <img src="/images/cocktails/savoy-pages.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">R.A.C. Special Cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the page doesn&rsquo;t quite go to the edge. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Savoy-Cocktail-Book-Harry-Craddock/dp/1614274304/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440964129&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=savoy+cocktail+book">edition I got</a> is a scanned version of the original, and it looks a little&hellip; unprofessional. Our local bar has a much nicer copy, with feathered edges.</p>

<p>I decided to start a journey of sorts, inspired by a game Jeff, the owner of <a href="http://thirdrailbarsf.com/">Third Rail</a>, plays with other bartenders. The game is as follows: you flip to any page in the book, put your finger on a cocktail, and then make something drinkable from it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky challenge if only because the recipes tend to be geared towards old liquors, which were less drinkable than they are now. For example, the gimlet recipe in the book states it should be &frac12; lime juice and &frac12; gin, which would be too citrus-forward even for me.</p>

<p>The other challenge for me is that some of the recipes have rather niche ingredients (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punsch">Swedish punsch</a>, anyone?) that I don&rsquo;t have. Although I suppose that&rsquo;s part of the fun – figuring out what you can replace certain ingredients with and still maintain the desired flavour.</p>

<p>My first cocktail ended up being the R.A.C. Special Cocktail. Their recipe: &frac12; dry gin, &frac14; sweet vermouth, &frac14; dry vermouth, and two dashes of orange bitters. Shake well, serve , and garnish with an orange peel. Here&rsquo;s the outcome.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">R.A.C. Special Cocktail</div>
</div>


<p>I lowered the vermouth slightly, to 1/8 of each. I think that makes a nicer cocktail. It tasted pretty much how you would expect – kind of a mix between a martini and a martinez/manhattan type thing. Certainly not that adventurous for a first cocktail, but pretty good nonetheless.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be using some of these recipes for inspiration for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-have-a-microphone/id964234004?mt=2">WHAM</a> drinks, too. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were in the mountains above Los Angeles for <a href="http://www.maxfuncon.com/">MaxFunCon</a>, a neat comedy/podcasting conference at which we had a lot of fun. Since we were in L.A., why not head to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, too?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Disneyland&rsquo;s 60th anniversary, so there&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff going on. In particular, the fireworks at Disneyland are spectacular. If you can make it before the celebrations are over, it&rsquo;s well worth it. Make sure to get a prime spot on Main Street and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>Anyway, the rides and all that are fun, but a more pressing question is: are those of us who like cocktails doomed to saccharine cruise-ship drinks while at the parks?</p>

<p>We set off to find out.</p>

<p>The first point: of the two parks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Resort">Disneyland Resort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">Disneyland</a> is completely dry (well, apart from <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/club33.asp">Club 33</a>). The only park you&rsquo;ll find a drink in is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_California_Adventure">Disney California Adventure</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where we started our investigatory stroll. Our first stop was the Alfresco Tasting Terrace. We&rsquo;d been there on a previous trip, but since then they had stopped serving cocktails. There&rsquo;s only wine and beer now.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/disney/june15/alfresco-terrace.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Alfresco Tasting Terrace</div>
</div>


<p>They have wine flights, which are pretty fun. And all the wineries seem to have some connection to Disney – some ex-executive started a winery, and now you can drink it here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a pretty good spot to grab a glass of wine to go. This is especially handy before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Color">World of Color</a> show. Seen below is us with our to-go cups of wine.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/disney/june15/alfresco-wine-to-go.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Booze you can take with you = the best</div>
</div>


<p>Our next stop was more fruitful: the Carthay Circle lounge. It gets busy after around 5pm, and the lounge is first-come-first-served, so make sure you get a seat. The drinks were good, and decently priced ($10-12 each). Because of the Disneyland 60th anniversary, they&rsquo;re putting diamond-shaped cubes in every drink (including Martinis and Manhattans), so if you want your drink unsullied, make sure to mention it.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/disney/june15/carthay-circle-lounge.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Carthay Circle Lounge</div>
</div>


<p>They didn&rsquo;t just have standard cocktails, either. They had some crème de violette/tequila thing that came with a candied flower on it. It tasted great!</p>

    <img src="/images/disney/june15/carthay-violet.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Violet cocktail from Carthay Circle</div>
</div>


<p>We headed over to The Cove, which is by the Paradise Pier area of the park. Like the Carthay Circle lounge, this place gets really busy, so come early. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun people-watching and sitting outside (if you can take a little sun). I was pleasantly surprised that the discontinued cocktail menu from the Alfresco Terrace was now over here! So I had my favourite drink from that – the Smoked Turkey.</p>

  <div class="alt">The Cove bar – Smoked Turkey and a Manhattan</div>
</div>


<p>(Oh, you should also get the lobster nachos while you&rsquo;re there. Deeeelicious.)</p>

<p>After we&rsquo;d exhausted Disney California Adventure, we went to our favourite bar at the resort – Trader Sam&rsquo;s Enchanted Tiki Bar. It&rsquo;s located by the pool at the Disneyland Hotel. It&rsquo;s a bit of a trek from the parks (about 10-15mins walk through Downtown Disney), but we enjoy it. Here&rsquo;s the entrance:</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-entrance.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Entrance to Trader Sam&#8217;s Enchanted Tiki Bar</div>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s a doorman – like every other bar, this one gets really busy. The doorman had implemented a one-in-one-out policy.</p>

<p>Inside, it&rsquo;s filled with trinkets and tchotchkes over the walls. Every surface is covered in this stuff, and it&rsquo;s really interesting to read/look at. Like everything at Disney theme parks, there&rsquo;s a back-story to every item. Nothing is just put up without thorough thought. There are letters from people Trader Sam has met on adventures. There&rsquo;s things people have mailed. It&rsquo;s quite incredible.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-indoor.jpg">
    <img src="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-indoor.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Inside Trader Sam&#8217;s</div>
</div>


<p>The drink menu has a standard tiki-theme – mostly rums and fruit juices. Most of the drinks have ridiculous names (&ldquo;Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum,&rdquo; for example).</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams1.jpg">
    <img src="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams1.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">HippopotoMai-Tai and a Lost Safari</div>
</div>


<p>The Mai Tai was fine, but nothing special. The Lost Safari was really good, though.</p>

<p>For our next round, I ordered the Krakatoa Punch. It came with a glowing &ldquo;ice-cube&rdquo; in it. When I ordered it, the bar lights went low. Through one of the trompe l&#8217;oiel &ldquo;windows&rdquo;, a volcano erupted in a neat little display.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-krakatoa.jpg">
    <img src="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-krakatoa.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Krakatoa Punch</div>
</div>


<p>In fact, these things happen for a number of drinks. Every 15 minutes or so, you&rsquo;ll be interrupted. The Shipwrek on the Rocks causes a ship in a painting behind the bar to sink. Plus the bartender sprays you with water.</p>

<p>Our final drink was the Uh Oa. It&rsquo;s a sharing drink, and arrives with a flaming sugar cube. You throw cinnamon and nutmeg onto the flames, creating sparks, while the whole bar erupts in chants of &ldquo;Uh oa! Uh oa!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-uh-oa.jpg">
    <img src="/images/disney/june15/trader-sams-uh-oa.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Uh Oa!</div>
</div>


<p>Trader Sam&rsquo;s is entertaining. It&rsquo;s exactly how you&rsquo;d imagine Disney would want a bar to be – adults can get the sense of fun and magic that is often left only to kids.</p>

<p>That was our drinking experience at Disneyland Resort. When we&rsquo;re next down at Walt Disney World, I&rsquo;ll try to do a similar thing for those parks, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve participated in pools for the Academy Awards. I like the Oscars anyway, but competing against other people to see who can guess the most winners adds an extra level of excitement.</p>

<p>In preparation for this year, and to learn a bit of Rails, I decided to make my own pool site. It&rsquo;s found at <a href="http://pool.malrase.com">pool.malrase.com</a>.</p>

<p>It costs $15 to enter and there&rsquo;s some more rules on the site. I&rsquo;d love for you to sign up, submit a ballot, and follow along with the 87th Academy Awards on the 22nd February!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times released its list of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/11/travel/52-places-to-go-in-2015.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">top places to go to in 2015</a>. It puts together two of my favourite things: easy-to-digest lists and travel destinations. This year&rsquo;s list was pretty exciting – among some places that we&rsquo;d visited on this past trip (Manhattan, Philadelphia, and, surprisingly, Orlando), there were a lot of places I&rsquo;m interested in visiting.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines">St Vincent and the Grenadines</a> in particular caught my eye. Singapore for its city-state strangeness and St Vincent for its diving. That <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2015/01/08/places-to-go/assets/images/stvincent-1254.jpg">coral reef photo</a> looks so inviting! But wait.</p>

<p>Before I can plan any more, before I get too excited about a new travel destination, I go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory">Wikipedia page for LGBT rights by country</a>. (Or, I recently found a great site called <a href="http://equaldex.com/">Equaldex</a>. I wanted to build something similar – it has a map and an easily-searchable database of countries showing the status of various LGBT-related laws.)</p>

<p>Does that seem strange? It still does to me, even though I do it fairly regularly. But unfortunately I feel like I have to. For example, checking out <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines">St Vincent and the Grenadines</a> shows me that male homosexuality is punishable by ten years in prison. I guess that takes it off the &ldquo;potential diving spots&rdquo; list.</p>

<p><a href="http://equaldex.com/region/singapore">Singapore</a> has a prison sentence of two years for gay guys. Another one off the list.</p>

<p>Going back to the New York Times list, there&rsquo;s a couple of countries that I know are not LGBT-friendly – Oman (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/oman">up to three years imprisonment</a>) and Morocco (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/morocco">six months imprisonment</a>). Checking some more, there&rsquo;s also St Kitts (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/saint-kitts-and-nevis">ten years imprisonment</a>), Zimbabwe (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/zimbabwe">up to ten years imprisonment</a>), Sri Lanka (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/sri-lanka">up to ten years</a>), Papua New Guinea (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/papua-new-guinea">up to fourteen years</a>), and Tanzania (a <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/tanzania"><em>minimum</em> of twenty years imprisonment</a>). That totals nine countries out of the fifty-two! I guess forty-three remaining travel destinations would still keep you pretty well-occupied.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just going off countries that ban same-sex activities, mind you. There&rsquo;s even more countries that don&rsquo;t ban LGBT discrimination. When looking at destinations, I&rsquo;m usually more lax with that. I mean heck, we couldn&rsquo;t even <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/united-states/florida">visit Florida</a> if I included places that allow LGBT discrimination in the &ldquo;no-travel&rdquo; list.</p>

<p>What does this serve? Am I just being unnecessarily anxious? Is this narrowing our experience of the world over something quite small? I mean, we&rsquo;re from two globally dominant countries. Surely LGBT travellers aren&rsquo;t arrested that regularly? There&rsquo;s a couple of high-profile cases that spring to mind – a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11142952/Call-for-boycott-of-Morocco-after-British-tourist-jailed-for-homosexual-acts.html">British gay guy was arrested in Morocco</a>, and <a href="http://www.travelandescape.ca/2013/07/first-tourists-have-been-arrested-under-putins-anti-gay-laws/">four LGBT Dutch people were arrested in Russia</a>. But the number of LGBT travellers far outweighs those, surely. We&rsquo;d probably be &ldquo;unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As well as the &ldquo;danger,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s also an aspect of avoiding such countries for economic reasons. We can freely choose to spend our money in, say, <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/spain">Spain</a> – which has far better equal rights for LGBT people – over another country that does not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird having to read through any destination list with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll maybe have to cut out about ~15% of it. I&rsquo;m interested to hear what anyone reading this – both LGBT and non-LGBT – thinks. Am I being too paranoid? Is it a valid, maybe arbitrary choice (I mean hey, it&rsquo;s a useful way to narrow down <em>all possible countries</em> into a smaller list, right)? Do you have any &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for choosing whether you&rsquo;ll visit a country?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people talk about how difficult 2014 was for them, and I must admit, it&rsquo;s been a pretty stressful year for me too. From quitting my job to putting on a conference to the Mozilla stuff and then travelling for seven months&hellip; it&rsquo;s been hectic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve visited four new countries (Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Mexico), stayed in many new cities (Prague, Stockholm, Vienna, Philadelphia, Raleigh, and Los Angeles – to name a few), and far too many airports.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to this upcoming year. It&rsquo;s filled with a lot of promise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz/">@Large</a> is an art exhibition created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei">Ai Weiwei</a> to be displayed specifically at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Federal_Penitentiary">Alcatraz</a>. You don&rsquo;t need special tickets to view it – you just buy <a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/">regular tickets to Alcatraz</a>. The art is scattered across a number of buildings/areas of the island, so you can explore it while you&rsquo;re on the regular Alcatraz tour.</p>

<div class="img">

  </a>
  <div class="alt">Poster at the Entrance</div>
</div>


<p>The exhibition includes an area I hadn&rsquo;t seen before – the <a href="http://www.for-site.org/places-artists/places/alcatraz-island/new-industries-building">New Industries Building</a>. Last time I visited it was closed off, so it was nice to visit an extra area of the island.</p>

<p>Inside are three of the installations: <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-with-wind/">With Wind</a>, <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-trace/">Trace</a>, and <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-refraction/">Refraction</a>. With Wind consists of traditional kite sculptures – one large dragon snaking through the room, plus a number of other smaller kites.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/with-wind.jpg">
    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/with-wind.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">With Wind</div>
</div>


<p>The dragon had &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; quotes written on it. The smaller kites were made of fabric printed with birds and animals from nations that have less-than-stellar human rights records.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/with-wind-2.jpg">
    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/with-wind-2.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">With Wind</div>
</div>


<p>The fact that these kites – usually symbols of freedom, soaring across the sky – are cooped up in a factory building was jarring.</p>

<p>The next room contained Trace. A series of portraits of political prisoners made in Lego covered the floor.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/trace.jpg">
    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/trace.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Trace – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Suk-ja">Shin Suk-ja</a></div>
</div>


<p>Along the side there were books explaining the portraits – who they were, where they were imprisoned, what they did to end up there. It was overwhelming, and a little difficult to connect with. The sheer number of prisoners – most of whom I&rsquo;d (shamefully) never heard of – made it impossible to know everything about all of them.</p>

<p>Looking at a couple, though, is worthwhile. The most surprising for me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kiriakou">John Kiriakou</a>, who was the first agent to relase the information that the CIA was using waterboarding to torture prisoners. He&rsquo;s currently serving jail time for this. <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-trace/">You can see a list of the political prisoners featured in the artwork on the installation&rsquo;s website.</a></p>

  <div class="alt">Trace – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kiriakou">John Kiriakou</a></div>
</div>


<p>In the old dining room, there&rsquo;s another part of @Large – <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-yours-truly/">Yours Truly</a>. Here you can write postcards to the prisoners depicted in Trace. The postcards are already addressed, and on the front have national plants or animals from the prisoner&rsquo;s home country.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/yours-truly.jpg">
    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/yours-truly.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Yours Truly</div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s a nice idea to remind these prisoners that there are people still thinking of them. I certainly felt good about writing a postcard. Afterwards, though, I wondered if they would actually reach the prisoners. I don&rsquo;t mean to question the honesty of the volunteers who mail them – but I&rsquo;m unsure as to whether the Bahrain government (or whereever) would allow their prisoners to get such a large amount of mail.</p>

<p>The hospital wing had an installation called <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-blossom/">Blossom</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
  <a href="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/blossom.jpg">
    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/blossom.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Blossom</div>
</div>


<p>It consisted of beautiful and delicate porcelain flowers arranged in the toilets, bathtubs, and sinks of the wing.</p>

<div class="img">

    <img src="/images/san-francisco/aiweiwei/blossom-2.jpg">
  </a>
  <div class="alt">Blossom</div>
</div>


<p>The flowers chosen were, again, national symbols of countries with serious human rights infractions.</p>

  <div class="alt">Blossom</div>
</div>


<p>Also on the tour there were two sound installations. <a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-illumination/">Illumination</a>, in the psychiatric cells of the hospital, had Tibetan and Native American chants echoing around the tiled rooms.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-stay-tuned/">Stay Tuned</a>, in A Wing, opened up some cells for you to sit in. Music, poetry, or speeches from political prisoners was piped in through a tiny grate in the floor. Sitting on a stool, alone, listening to these songs gave me a strong feeling of shame. It was certainly the biggest emotional reaction I got from the exhibit.</p>

<p>Here I was, having paid to come here. I chose to sit in a jail cell and listen to music. I could get up and leave at any point I wanted. I was – dare I say it – having <em>fun</em>. It was a little perverse.</p>

<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s the point? It managed to open my eyes to a wider issue, and obviously one that Ai Weiwei is concerned about. I&rsquo;ve researched more of the political prisoners since visiting the exhibit.</p>

<p>So, at least in that way, the exhibition is a great success.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz/">@Large: Ai Weiwei on Alcatraz</a> runs until 26th April 2015.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida">Jacksonville</a>, Hampton&rsquo;s hometown, is pretty sprawling. As such, it&rsquo;s difficult to get to different areas of the city without driving. Thankfully, Uber recently arrived so you can drink and get home safely (although with all the recent controversy, I don&rsquo;t know how comfortable you might be with using Uber).</p>

<p>The main areas of town we went to were Downtown, San Marco, and Avondale.</p>

<p>In Downtown, I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="http://www.dosgatosjax.com/">Dos Gatos</a>. The cocktails are great and reasonably-priced.</p>

<p>San Marco has <a href="http://www.grapeandgrainexchange.com/">Grape and Grain Exchange</a>, with the Parlour in the back. Grape and Grain Exchange is an up-scale package store. They have a great range of liquors there – and we got some to drink at home. However it&rsquo;s worth grabbing a drink at the bar, too. The atmosphere is a little bright – it is primarily a shop, after all – but the cocktails are good. In the back there&rsquo;s the Parlour, which is a speakeasy-style bar. The service is pretty slow but they have some decent seasonal cocktails.</p>

<p>Avondale&rsquo;s top spot for drinking is <a href="http://www.mojobbq.com/mojo-no-4-urban-bbq-whiskey-bar">Mojo Nº4</a>. They have an extensive range of whiskey cocktails, all of which were tasty. Their Vieux Carré was great.</p>

<p>If Mojos is packed (and it often is, so get there early), try the <a href="http://mellowmushroom.com/store/avondale-jax">Mellow Mushroom</a> just across the street. Their pizza is pretty good, too, if you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>

<p>All in all, there&rsquo;s a few good spots around town if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent cocktail. Just make sure you have a taxi number handy to get home!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a plane. We&rsquo;re travelling back to San Francisco after seven months of being away from home. Here are some fun facts about our trip.</p>

<ul>
<li>226 days on the road</li>
<li>10 countries (with seven languages) visited</li>
<li>21 airports (SFO, IAD, DCA, ATL, JAX, PHL, CDG, VIE, AGP, LPL, STN, PRG, AMS, SXF, TXL, ARN, LHR, EWR, YTZ, JFK, DFW)</li>
<li>10 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage</a> sites (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_Czech_Republic">Historic Centre of Prague</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London">Tower of London</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster">Westminster</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam">Canals of Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Historic Centre of Vienna</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine">Banks of the Seine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Hall">Independence Hall</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello">Monticello</a>)</li>
<li>41 films watched (3 on a plane, 14 in the cinema, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes">1 with mostly Czech subtitles so I didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on</a>)</li>
<li>8 conferences attended</li>
<li>2 birthdays celebrated</li>
<li>1 Kindle lost</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking back, it&rsquo;s certainly been a lot of fun. But it&rsquo;s also been pretty stressful. At least, I remember it being stressful at the time. Already the rosiness of hindsight is taking over and I almost wish I was back travelling again.</p>

<p><em>Almost</em> wish. I&rsquo;m not leaving my couch for a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For our five year anniversary, we decided to head down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Walt Disney World</a> for a few days. I had never stayed &ldquo;on property&rdquo; (i.e. in a Disney-branded hotel) before, so we opted to stay in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Port_Orleans_Resort">French Quarter New Orleans</a>. It&rsquo;s priced in the middle of the pack – not as expensive as the Grand Floridian or the Contemporary, but not as cheap as the All-Star resorts. (See a handy table on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World#On-site_Disney_resorts">Wikipedia page</a>.)</p>

<p>We also wanted to get our hands on the new Disney <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyMagic%2B#MagicBand">MagicBand</a>. It&rsquo;s an all-in-one ticket to the parks, key to your room, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Fastpass">FastPass</a>. We were really excited about getting them. You customise them online and they come in the mail.</p>

<p>The packaging reminded me of an Apple product – it was uncluttered and put the product up front.</p>

<p>Staying on-site also gives you the opportunity to take the Disney buses from hotels to the parks. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about the hellish carpark at the end of the day. We decided to do the Disney dining plan, too – one snack, one quick meal, and one sit-down meal per day.</p>

<p>We checked into the hotel, and although the surroundings were nice, the room was disappointing. It was laid out exactly like a motel – a sink area you can see as you walk in the door, a curtain to separate it from the rest of the room. It seemed like that could be a useful layout for families, but it didn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;magical&rdquo; feeling I was expecting – especially for the price we were paying. I couldn&rsquo;t help but compare it to the far better Lowes Royal Pacific Resort at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Orlando">Universal</a>, where we stayed the previous week.</p>

<p>We were there for four days – with one day in each of the four WDW parks. On our first day, we headed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">Epcot</a> to catch the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot_International_Food_%26_Wine_Festival">Food and Wine Festival</a>. Held every autumn, they put up extra food stands around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot#World_Showcase">World Showcase</a> representing different countries/cultures.</p>

<p>Anyway, as Epcot is one of the parks where you can drink, we decided to take advantage of the Disney bus system. Here&rsquo;s a pro-tip: <strong>don&rsquo;t use the Disney bus system</strong>. Waiting at our hotel&rsquo;s bus stop, was awful. Three or four buses for the same park would go past, and no passengers would get on. When our bus did come by, it was packed. After about fifteen minutes&#8217; wait for the bus, it was another fifteen minutes to get to the park. Then you&rsquo;re dropped off quite far from the entrance, so there&rsquo;s some extra walking. It was <strong>not</strong> worth it. In the Disney vs. Universal battle, the walkable distance from the parks to the resort hotels makes Universal a much more convenient experience.</p>

<p>Our day at Epcot was a lot of fun, though. Spending a whole day at Epcot allowed us to wander through the World Showcase. We managed to walk through all the countries – into the back areas and shops, which tended to be empty. The amount of detail is incredible. It also helps that some of the countries (such as France and Germany) have wine. That kept us in a good mood.</p>

</div>


<p>We did Hollywood Studios the next day, then the Magic Kingdom. I was blown away by how busy the Magic Kingdom was – it was a Wednesday in the off-season and even high-throughput rides like Pirates of the Caribbean or the Haunted Mansion were at 50-minute queue times.</p>

<p>Animal Kingdom we left for the final day. They&rsquo;re apparently undergoing a lot of expansion, and we wanted to check it out before <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/01/construction-begins-for-avatar-inspired-land-at-disneys-animal-kingdom/">Avatar land opens</a>. We rode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_Everest">Expedition Everest</a> a couple of times – it&rsquo;s a great ride, but the only must-do at Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p>Two other disappointing things: the dining package and the FastPass options on the MagicBand. We got the standard dining package which, as I mentioned above, covers a snack, quick serve meal, and a sit-down meal. We booked it through Disney – as we were staying there three nights, we assumed the package would cover four days. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not the case – so be aware of that.</p>

<p>Also, the sit-down meal gives you two courses. However those two courses are <em>only</em> the entrée and dessert. You can&rsquo;t switch the dessert for an appetiser. That kinda sucked for us as neither of us really eat dessert.</p>

<p>We used two of our &ldquo;sit-down&rdquo; credits on <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/grand-floridian-resort-and-spa/citricos/">Citricos</a>, the fancy restaurant in the Grand Floridian. I&rsquo;ve got to say – the overall experience was a little strange. The food was top-notch, and you could see the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the main dining hall. But the drinks were terrible and there were mostly families there – so not particularly romantic or anything. Can&rsquo;t really complain about families, though, it being Disney and all that.</p>

<p>The best thing to do if you <em>do</em> get the deal is grab a Starbucks coffee at either the Magic Kingdom or Epcot. It counts as a snack – no matter how many extra espresso shots you get. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>FastPass is the way you skip lines at Disney. You used to get a card with a specific return time on it, but now you pre-arrange three rides you want to do at specific times. Staying on Disney property <em>does not</em> give you more than three. Everyone gets that. Compare with Universal, where if you stay on property you get an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Express_Pass">Express Pass</a> &ldquo;free,&rdquo; and it works any number of times for all designated rides.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be staying at a Disney resort any time soon. If we do, I think it would have to be one with better transit options (i.e. one on the monorail). Driving to the parks is a far better option than the bus. I just don&rsquo;t see any real benefit that staying on-property offers.</p>
